       "      <td>Judge: Do you want Mr. Bryan sworn? :Darrow: No. :Bryan: I can make affirmation; I can say \"So help me God, I will tell the truth. \": Darrow: No, I take it you will tell the truth, Mr. Bryan. You have given considerable study to the Bible, haven't you, Mr. Bryan? :Bryan: Yes, sir, I have tried to. :Darrow: Then you have made a general study of it? :Bryan: Yes, I have; I have studied the Bible for about 50 years, or sometime more than that, but, of course, I have studied it more as I have become older than when I was but a boy. :Darrow: You claim that everything in the Bible should be literally interpreted? :Bryan: I believe everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there: some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: \"Ye are the salt of the earth. \" I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving God's people. :Darrow: But when you read that Jonah swallowed the whale--or that the whale swallowed Jonah--excuse me please--how do you literally interpret that? :Bryan: When I read that a \"big fish\" swallowed Jonah--it does not say whale. That is my recollection of it. A big fish, and I believe it, and I believe in a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both what He pleases. :Darrow: Now, you say, the big fish swallowed Jonah, and he there remained how long--three days--and then he spewed him upon the land. You believe that the big fish was made to swallow Jonah? :Bryan: I am not prepared to say that; the Bible merely says it was done. :Darrow: You don't know whether it was the ordinary run of fish, or made for that purpose? :Bryan: You may guess; you evolutionists guess. . :Darrow: You are not prepared to say whether that fish was made especially to swallow a man or not? :Bryan: The Bible doesn't say, so I am not prepared to say. :Darrow: But do you believe He made them--that He made such a fish and that it was big enough to swallow Jonah? :Bryan: Yes, sir. Let me add: One miracle is just as easy to believe as another. :Darrow: Just as hard? :Bryan: It is hard to believe for you, but easy for me. A miracle is a thing performed beyond what man can perform. When you get within the realm of miracles; and it is just as easy to believe the miracle of Jonah as any other miracle in the Bible. :Darrow: Perfectly easy to believe that Jonah swallowed the whale? :Bryan: If the Bible said so; the Bible doesn't make as extreme statements as evolutionists do. :Darrow: The Bible says Joshua commanded the sun to stand still for the purpose of lengthening the day, doesn't it, and you believe it. :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Do you believe at that time the entire sun went around the earth? :Bryan: No, I believe that the earth goes around the sun. :Darrow: Do you believe that the men who wrote it thought that the day could be lengthened or that the sun could be stopped? :Bryan: I don't know what they thought. :Darrow: You don't know? :Bryan: I think they wrote the fact without expressing their own thoughts. :Darrow: Have you an opinion as to whether or not the men who wrote that thought--: Thomas Stewart: (a prosecution lawyer)--I want to object, your honor. It has gone beyond the pale of any issue that could possibly be injected into this lawsuit, except by imagination. I do not think the defendant has a right to conduct the examination any further and I ask your honor to exclude it. :Bryan: It seems to me it would be too exacting to confine the defense to the facts. If they are not allowed to get away from the facts, what have they to deal with? :Judge: Mr. Bryan is willing to be examined. Go ahead. :Darrow: Can you answer my question directly? If the day was lengthened by stopping either the earth or the sun, it must have been the earth? :Bryan: Well, I should say so. :Darrow: Now, Mr. Bryan, have you ever pondered what would have happened to the earth if it had stood still? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: You have not? :Bryan: No; the God I believe in could have taken care of that, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: I see. Have you ever pondered what would naturally happen to the earth if it stood still suddenly? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Don't you know it would have been converted into molten mass of matter? :Bryan: You testify to that when you get on the stand, I will give you a chance. :Darrow: Don't you believe it? :Bryan: I would want to hear expert testimony on that. :Darrow: You have never investigated that subject? :Bryan: I don't think I have ever had the question asked. :Darrow: Or ever thought of it? :Bryan: I have been too busy on things that I thought were of more importance. :Darrow: You believe the story of the flood to be a literal interpretation? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: When was that flood? :Bryan: I would not attempt to fix the date. The date is fixed, as suggested this morning. :Darrow: About 4004 B. C. ?: Bryan: That has been the estimate of a man that is accepted today. [A witness had testified on Bishop Ussher's theory that the Earth was formed in 4004 B. C. ] I would not say it is accurate. :Darrow: That estimate is printed in the Bible? :Bryan: Everybody knows, at least, I think most of the people know, that was the estimate given. :Darrow: But what do you think that the Bible itself says? Don't you know how it was arrived at? :Bryan: I never made a calculation. :Darrow: A calculation from what? :Bryan: I could not say. :Darrow: From the generations of man? :Bryan: I would not want to say that. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think about things I don't think about. :Darrow: Do you think about things you do think about? :Bryan: Well, sometimes. (Laughter. ): Policeman Deputy Clason: Let us have order. . .: Thomas Stewart: {prosecution attorney}--Your honor, he is perfectly able to take care of this, but we are attaining no evidence. This is not competent evidence. :Bryan: These gentlemen have not had much chance--they did not come here to try this case. They came here to try revealed religion. I am here to defend it and they can ask me any question they please. :Judge: All right. (Applause. ): Darrow: Great applause from the bleachers. :Bryan: Darrow--I have never called them yokels. :Bryan: That is the ignorance of Tennessee, the bigotry. :Darrow: You mean who are applauding you? (Applause. ): Bryan: Those are the people whom you insult. :Darrow: You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does believe in your fool religion. :Judge: I will not stand for that. :Darrow: For what he is doing? :Judge: I am talking to both of you. :Darrow: Do you know anything about how many people there were in Egypt 3, 500 years ago, or how many people there were in China 5, 000 years ago? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Have you ever tried to find out? :Bryan: No, sir. You are the first man I ever heard of who has been interested in it. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, am I the first man you ever heard of who has been interested in the age of human societies and primitive man? :Bryan: You are the first man I ever heard speak of the number of people at those different periods. :Darrow: Where have you lived all your life? :Bryan: Not near you. (Laughter and applause. ): Darrow: Nor near anybody of learning? :Bryan: Oh, don't assume you know it all. :Darrow: Do you know there are thousands of books in our libraries on all those subjects I have been asking you about? :Bryan: I couldn't say, but I will take your word for it. . .: Darrow: Have you any idea how old the earth is? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The book you have introduced in evidence tells you, doesn't it? :Bryan: I don't think it does, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: Let's see whether it does; is this the one? :Bryan: That is the one, I think. :Darrow: It says B. C. 4004? :Bryan: That is Bishop Ussher's calculation. :Darrow: That is printed in the Bible you introduced? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: Would you say that the earth was only 4, 000 years old? :Bryan: Oh, no; I think it is much older than that. :Darrow: How much? :Bryan: I couldn't say. :Darrow: Do you say whether the Bible itself says it is older than that? :Bryan: I don't think it is older or not. :Darrow: Do you think the earth was made in six days? :Bryan: Not six days of 24 hours. :Darrow: Doesn't it say so? :Bryan: No, sir. :Judge: Are you about through, Mr. Darrow? :Darrow: I want to ask a few more questions about the creation. :Judge: I know. We are going to adjourn when Mr. Bryan comes off the stand for the day. Be very brief, Mr. Darrow. Of course, I believe I will make myself clearer. Of course, it is incompetent testimony before the jury. The only reason I am allowing this to go in at all is that they may have it in the appellate court as showing what the affidavit would be. :Bryan: The reason I am answering is not for the benefit of the superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him. :Darrow: I want to take an exception to this conduct of this witness. He may be very popular down here in the hills--: Bryan: Your honor, they have not asked a question legally and the only reason they have asked any question is for the purpose, as the question about Jonah was asked, for a chance to give this agnostic an opportunity to criticize a believer in the world of God; and I answered the question in order to shut his mouth so that he cannot go out and tell his atheistic friends that I would not answer his questions. That is the only reason, no more reason in the world. :Malone: (another defense counsel) Your honor on this very subject, I would like to say that I would have asked Mr. Bryan, and I consider myself as good a Christian as he is, every question that Mr. Darrow has asked him for the purpose of bringing out whether or not there is to be taken in this court a literal interpretation of the Bible, or whether, obviously, as these questions indicate, if a general and literal construction cannot be put upon the parts of the Bible which have been covered by Mr. Darrow's questions. I hope for the last time no further attempt will be made by counsel on the other side of the case, or Mr. Bryan, to say the defense is concerned at all with Mr. Darrow's particular religious views or lack of religious views. We are here as lawyers with the same right to our views. I have the same right to mine as a Christian as Mr. Bryan has to his, and we do not intend to have this case charged by Mr. Darrow's agnosticism or Mr. Bryan's brand of Christianity. (A great applause. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, do you believe that the first woman was Eve? :Bryan: Yes. :Darrow: Do you believe she was literally made out of Adam's rib? :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Did you ever discover where Cain got his wife? :Bryan: No, sir. I leave the agnostics to hunt for her. :Darrow: You have never found out? :Bryan: I have never tried to find out. :Darrow: You have never tried to find out? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The Bible says he got one, doesn't it? Were there other people on the earth at that time? :Bryan: I cannot say. :Darrow: You cannot say. Did that ever enter your consideration? :Bryan: Never bothered me. :Darrow: There were no others recorded, but Cain got a wife. :Bryan: That is what the Bible says. :Darrow: Where she came from you do not know. All right. Does the statement, \"The morning and the evening were the first day, \" and \"The morning and the evening were the second day, \" mean anything to you? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily means a 24-hour day. :Darrow: You do not? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: What do you consider it to be? :Bryan: I have not attempted to explain it. If you will take the second chapter--let me have the book. [Reaches for a Bible. ] The fourth verse of the second chapter says: \"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth, when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, \" the word day there in the very next chapter is used to describe a period. I do not see that there is any necessity for construing the words, \"the evening and the morning, \" as meaning necessarily a 24-hour day, \"in the day when the Lord made the heaven and the earth. \": Darrow: Then, when the Bible said, for instance, \"and God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day, \" that does not necessarily mean twenty-four hours? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily does. :Darrow: Do you think it does or does not? :Bryan: I know a great many think so. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think it does. :Darrow: You think those were not literal days? :Bryan: I do not think they were twenty-four-hour days. :Darrow: What do you think about it? :Bryan: That is my opinion--I do not know that my opinion is better on that subject than those who think it does. :Darrow: You do not think that? :Bryan: No. But I think it would be just as easy for the kind of God we believe in to make the earth in six days as in six years or in 6 million years or in 600 million years. I do not think it important whether we believe one or the other. :Darrow: Do you think those were literal days? :Bryan: My impression is they were periods, but I would not attempt to argue against anybody who wanted to believe in literal days. :Darrow: I will read it to you from the Bible: \"And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. \" Do you think that is why the serpent is compelled to crawl upon its belly? :Bryan: I believe that. :Darrow: Have you any idea how the snake went before that time? :Bryan: No, sir. :Darrow: Do you know whether he walked on his tail or not? :Bryan: No, sir. I have no way to know. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Now, you refer to the cloud that was put in heaven after the flood, the rainbow. Do you believe in that? :Bryan: Read it. :Darrow: All right, Mr. Bryan, I will read it for you. :Bryan: Your Honor, I think I can shorten this testimony. The only purpose Mr. Darrow has is to slur at the Bible, but I will answer his question. I will answer it all at once, and I have no objection in the world. I want the world to know that this man, who does not believe in a God, is trying to use a court in Tennessee to slur at it, and while it will require time, I am willing to take it. :Darrow: I object to your statement. I am examining you on your fool ideas that no intelligent Christian on earth believes. :Judge: Court is adjourned until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. :* Clarence Darrow's examination of William Jennings Bryan at the 1925 Scopes trial Scopes Trial Day 7</td>\n",

In it the narrator declares \"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing\", although since the original is in Russian various translations to English are possible. This purported quote also bears resemblance to a quote misattributed to Plato (Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations) \"The penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men. \" It also bears resemblance to what Albert Einstein wrote as part of his tribute to Pablo Casals: \"The world is in greater peril from those who tolerate or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it. \": : More research done on this matter is available at these two links: Burkequote &amp; Burkequote2 — as the information at these links indicates, there are many variants of this statement, probably because there is no known original by Burke.

They closely resemble remarks known to have been made by the Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill, in an address at the University of St. Andrews (1 February 1867): Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. The very extensively used remarks attributed to Burke might be based on a paraphrase of some of his ideas, but he is not known to have ever declared them in so succinct a manner in any of his writings. It has been suggested that they may have been adapted from these lines of Burke's in his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents (1770): \"When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle. \" (see above)</td>\n",

       "      <td>We stand for a living wage. Wages are subnormal if they fail to provide a living for those who devote their time and energy to industrial occupations. The monetary equivalent of a living wage varies according to local conditions, but must include enough to secure the elements of a normal standard of living--a standard high enough to make morality possible, to provide for education and recreation, to care for immature members of the family, to maintain the family during periods of sickness, and to permit of reasonable saving for old age. Hours are excessive if they fail to afford the worker sufficient time to recuperate and return to his work thoroughly refreshed. We hold that the night labor of women and children is abnormal and should be prohibited; we hold that the employment of women over forty-eight hours per week is abnormal and should be prohibited. We hold that the seven day working week is abnormal, and we hold that one day of rest in seven should be provided in law. We hold that the continuous industries, operating twenty-four hours out of twenty-four, are abnormal, and where, because of public necessity or of technical reasons (such as molten metal), the twenty-four hours must be divided into two shifts of twelve hours or three shifts of eight, they should by law be divided into three of eight. Safety conditions are abnormal when, through unguarded machinery, poisons, electrical voltage, or otherwise, the workers are subjected to unnecessary hazards of life and limb; and all such occupations should come under governmental regulation and control. Home life is abnormal when tenement manufacture is carried on in the household. It is a serious menace to health, education, and childhood, and should therefore be entirely prohibited. Temporary construction camps are abnormal homes and should be subjected to governmental sanitary regulation. The premature employment of children is abnormal and should be prohibited; so also the employment of women in manufacturing, commerce, or other trades where work compels standing constantly; and also any employment of women in such trades for a period of at least eight weeks at time of childbirth. Our aim should be to secure conditions which will tend everywhere towards regular industry, and will do away with the necessity for rush periods, followed by out-of-work seasons, which put so severe a strain on wage-workers. It is abnormal for any industry to throw back upon the community the human wreckage due to its wear and tear, and the hazzards of sickness, accident, invalidism, involuntary unemployment, and old age should be provided for through insurance. This should be made a charge in whole or in part upon the industries the employer, the employee, and perhaps the people at large, to contribute severally in some degree. Wherever such standards are not met by given establishments, by given industries, are unprovided for by a legislature, or are balked by unenlightened courts, the workers are in jeopardy, the progressive employer is penalized, and the community pays a heavy cost in lessened efficiency and in misery. What Germany has done in the way of old age pensions or insurance should be studied by us, and the system adapted to our uses, with whatever modifications are rendered necessary by our different ways of life and habits of thought. Workingwomen have the same need to combine for protection that workingmen have; the ballot is as necessary for one class as for the other; we do not believe that with the two sexes there is identity of function; but we do believe that there should be equality of right; and therefore we favor woman suffrage. In those conservative States where there is genuine doubt how the women stand on this matter I suggest that it be referred to a vote of the women, so that they may themselves make the decision. Surely if women could vote, they would strengthen the hands of those who are endeavoring to deal in efficient fashion with evils such as the white slave traffic; evils which can in part be dealt with Nationally, but which in large part can be reached only by determined local action, such as insisting on the widespread publication of the names of the owners, the landlords, of houses used for immoral purposes. No people are more vitally interested than workingmen and workingwomen in questions affecting the public health. The pure food law must be strengthened and efficiently enforced. In the National Government one department should be intrusted with all the agencies relating to the public health, from the enforcement of the pure food law to the administration of quarantine. This department, through its special health service, would co-operate intelligently with the various State and municipal bodies established for the same end. There would be no discrimination against or for any one set of therapeutic methods, against or for any one school of medicine or system of healing; the aim would be merely to secure under one administrative body efficient sanitary regulation in the interest of the people as a whole.</td>\n",

I never had any special interest in the church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly. :: In his original statement Einstein was probably referring to the actions of the Emergency Covenant of Pastors organized by Martin Niemöller, and the Confessing Church which he and other prominent churchmen such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer established in opposition to Nazi policies. :: Einstein also made some scathingly negative comments about the behavior of the Church under the Nazi regime (and its behavior towards Jews throughout history) in a 1943 conversation with William Hermanns recorded in Hermanns' book Einstein and the Poet (1983). On p. 63 Hermanns records him saying \"Never in history has violence been so widespread as in Nazi Germany. The concentration camps make the actions of Genghis Khan look like child's play. But what makes me shudder is that the Church is silent. One doesn't need to be a prophet to say, 'The Catholic Church will pay for this silence. ' Dr. Hermanns, you will live to see that there is moral law in the universe. . .There are cosmic laws, Dr. Hermanns. They cannot be bribed by prayers or incense. What an insult to the principles of creation. But remember, that for God a thousand years is a day. This power maneuver of the Church, these Concordats through the centuries with worldly powers. . the Church has to pay for it. We live now in a scientific age and in a psychological age. You are a sociologist, aren't you? You know what the Herdenmenschen (men of herd mentality) can do when they are organized and have a leader, especially if he is a spokesmen for the Church. I do not say that the unspeakable crimes of the Church for 2000 years had always the blessings of the Vatican, but it vaccinated its believers with the idea: We have the true God, and the Jews have crucified Him. The Church sowed hate instead of love, though the Ten Commandments state: Thou shalt not kill. \" And then on p. 64: \"I'm not a Communist but I can well understand why they destroyed the Church in Russia. All the wrongs come home, as the proverb says. The Church will pay for its dealings with Hitler, and Germany, too. \" And on p. 65: \"I don't like to implant in youth the Church's doctrine of a personal God, because that Church has behaved so inhumanely in the past 2000 years. The fear of punishment makes the people march. Consider the hate the Church manifested against the Jews and then against the Muslims, the Crusades with their crimes, the burning stakes of the Inquisition, the tacit consent of Hitler's actions while the Jews and the Poles dug their own graves and were slaughtered. And Hitler is said to have been an altar boy! The truly religious man has no fear of life and no fear of death—and certainly no blind faith; his faith must be in his conscience. . . I am therefore against all organized religion. Too often in history, men have followed the cry of battle rather than the cry of truth. \" When Hermanns asked him \"Isn't it only human to move along the line of least resistance? \", Einstein responded \"Yes. It is indeed human, as proved by Cardinal Pacelli, who was behind the Concordat with Hitler. Since when can one make a pact with Christ and Satan at the same time? And he is now the Pope! The moment I hear the word 'religion', my hair stands on end. The Church has always sold itself to those in power, and agreed to any bargain in return for immunity. It would have been fine if the spirit of religion had guided the Church; instead, the Church determined the spirit of religion. Churchmen through the ages have fought political and institutional corruption very little, so long as their own sanctity and church property were preserved. \"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Attributed in \"The Conflict Between Church And State In The Third Reich\", by S. Parkes Cadman, La Crosse Tribune and Leader-Press (28 October 1934), viewable online on p. 9 of the issue here (double-click the page to zoom). The quote is preceded by \"In this connection it is worth quoting in free translation a statement made by Professor Einstein last year to one of my colleagues who has been prominently identified with the Protestant church in its contacts with Germany. \" [Emphasis added. ] While based on something that Einstein said, Einstein himself stated that the quote was not an accurate record of his words or opinion. After the quote appeared in Time magazine (23 December 1940), p. 38, a minister in Harbor Springs, Michigan wrote to Einstein to check if the quote was real. Einstein wrote back \"It is true that I made a statement which corresponds approximately with the text you quoted. I made this statement during the first years of the Nazi-Regime — much earlier than 1940 — and my expressions were a little more moderate. \" (March 1943) In a later letter to Rev. Cornelius Greenway of Brooklyn, who asked if Einstein would write out the statement in his own hand, Einstein was more vehement in his repudiation of the statement (14 November 1950): The wording of the statement you have quoted is not my own. Shortly after Hitler came to power in Germany I had an oral conversation with a newspaper man about these matters. Since then my remarks have been elaborated and exaggerated nearly beyond recognition. I cannot in good conscience write down the statement you sent me as my own. The matter is all the more embarrassing to me because I, like yourself, I am predominantly critical concerning the activities, and especially the political activities, through history of the official clergy. Thus, my former statement, even if reduced to my actual words (which I do not remember in detail) gives a wrong impression of my general attitude.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In those days I had seen little further than the old school of political economists into the possibilities of fundamental improvement in social arrangements. Private property, as now understood, and inheritance, appeared to me, as to them, the dernier mot of legislation: and I looked no further than to mitigating the inequalities consequent on these institutions, by getting rid of primogeniture and entails. The notion that it was possible to go further than this in removing the injustice—for injustice it is, whether admitting of a complete remedy or not—involved in the fact that some are born to riches and the vast majority to poverty, I then reckoned chimerical, and only hoped that by universal education, leading to voluntary restraint on population, the portion of the poor might be made more tolerable. In short, I was a democrat, but not the least of a Socialist. We were now much less democrats than I had been, because so long as education continues to be so wretchedly imperfect, we dreaded the ignorance and especially the selfishness and brutality of the mass: but our ideal of ultimate improvement went far beyond Democracy, and would class us decidedly under the general designation of Socialists. While we repudiated with the greatest energy that tyranny of society over the individual which most Socialistic systems are supposed to involve, we yet looked forward to a time when society will no longer be divided into the idle and the industrious; when the rule that they who do not work shall not eat, will be applied not to paupers only, but impartially to all; when the division of the produce of labour, instead of depending, as in so great a degree it now does, on the accident of birth, will be made by concert on an acknowledged principle of justice; and when it will no longer either be, or be thought to be, impossible for human beings to exert themselves strenuously in procuring benefits which are not to be exclusively their own, but to be shared with the society they belong to. The social problem of the future we considered to be, how to unite the greatest individual liberty of action, with a common ownership in the raw material of the globe, and an equal participation of all in the benefits of combined labour. We had not the presumption to suppose that we could already foresee, by what precise form of institutions these objects could most effectually be attained, or at how near or how distant a period they would become practicable. We saw clearly that to render any such social transformation either possible or desirable, an equivalent change of character must take place both in the uncultivated herd who now compose the labouring masses, and in the immense majority of their employers. Both these classes must learn by practice to labour and combine for generous, or at all events for public and social purposes, and not, as hitherto, solely for narrowly interested ones. But the capacity to do this has always existed in mankind, and is not, nor is ever likely to be, extinct. Education, habit, and the cultivation of the sentiments, will make a common man dig or weave for his country, as readily as fight for his country. True enough, it is only by slow degrees, and a system of culture prolonged through successive generations, that men in general can be brought up to this point. But the hindrance is not in the essential constitution of human nature. Interest in the common good is at present so weak a motive in the generality not because it can never be otherwise, but because the mind is not accustomed to dwell on it as it dwells from morning till night on things which tend only to personal advantage. When called into activity, as only self-interest now is, by the daily course of life, and spurred from behind by the love of distinction and the fear of shame, it is capable of producing, even in common men, the most strenuous exertions as well as the most heroic sacrifices. The deep-rooted selfishness which forms the general character of the existing state of society, is so deeply rooted, only because the whole course of existing institutions tends to foster it; modern institutions in some respects more than ancient, since the occasions on which the individual is called on to do anything for the public without receiving its pay, are far less frequent in modern life, than the smaller commonwealths of antiquity.</td>\n",

       "9023   Judge: Do you want Mr. Bryan sworn? :Darrow: No. :Bryan: I can make affirmation; I can say \"So help me God, I will tell the truth. \": Darrow: No, I take it you will tell the truth, Mr. Bryan. You have given considerable study to the Bible, haven't you, Mr. Bryan? :Bryan: Yes, sir, I have tried to. :Darrow: Then you have made a general study of it? :Bryan: Yes, I have; I have studied the Bible for about 50 years, or sometime more than that, but, of course, I have studied it more as I have become older than when I was but a boy. :Darrow: You claim that everything in the Bible should be literally interpreted? :Bryan: I believe everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there: some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: \"Ye are the salt of the earth. \" I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving God's people. :Darrow: But when you read that Jonah swallowed the whale--or that the whale swallowed Jonah--excuse me please--how do you literally interpret that? :Bryan: When I read that a \"big fish\" swallowed Jonah--it does not say whale. That is my recollection of it. A big fish, and I believe it, and I believe in a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both what He pleases. :Darrow: Now, you say, the big fish swallowed Jonah, and he there remained how long--three days--and then he spewed him upon the land. You believe that the big fish was made to swallow Jonah? :Bryan: I am not prepared to say that; the Bible merely says it was done. :Darrow: You don't know whether it was the ordinary run of fish, or made for that purpose? :Bryan: You may guess; you evolutionists guess. . :Darrow: You are not prepared to say whether that fish was made especially to swallow a man or not? :Bryan: The Bible doesn't say, so I am not prepared to say. :Darrow: But do you believe He made them--that He made such a fish and that it was big enough to swallow Jonah? :Bryan: Yes, sir. Let me add: One miracle is just as easy to believe as another. :Darrow: Just as hard? :Bryan: It is hard to believe for you, but easy for me. A miracle is a thing performed beyond what man can perform. When you get within the realm of miracles; and it is just as easy to believe the miracle of Jonah as any other miracle in the Bible. :Darrow: Perfectly easy to believe that Jonah swallowed the whale? :Bryan: If the Bible said so; the Bible doesn't make as extreme statements as evolutionists do. :Darrow: The Bible says Joshua commanded the sun to stand still for the purpose of lengthening the day, doesn't it, and you believe it. :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Do you believe at that time the entire sun went around the earth? :Bryan: No, I believe that the earth goes around the sun. :Darrow: Do you believe that the men who wrote it thought that the day could be lengthened or that the sun could be stopped? :Bryan: I don't know what they thought. :Darrow: You don't know? :Bryan: I think they wrote the fact without expressing their own thoughts. :Darrow: Have you an opinion as to whether or not the men who wrote that thought--: Thomas Stewart: (a prosecution lawyer)--I want to object, your honor. It has gone beyond the pale of any issue that could possibly be injected into this lawsuit, except by imagination. I do not think the defendant has a right to conduct the examination any further and I ask your honor to exclude it. :Bryan: It seems to me it would be too exacting to confine the defense to the facts. If they are not allowed to get away from the facts, what have they to deal with? :Judge: Mr. Bryan is willing to be examined. Go ahead. :Darrow: Can you answer my question directly? If the day was lengthened by stopping either the earth or the sun, it must have been the earth? :Bryan: Well, I should say so. :Darrow: Now, Mr. Bryan, have you ever pondered what would have happened to the earth if it had stood still? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: You have not? :Bryan: No; the God I believe in could have taken care of that, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: I see. Have you ever pondered what would naturally happen to the earth if it stood still suddenly? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Don't you know it would have been converted into molten mass of matter? :Bryan: You testify to that when you get on the stand, I will give you a chance. :Darrow: Don't you believe it? :Bryan: I would want to hear expert testimony on that. :Darrow: You have never investigated that subject? :Bryan: I don't think I have ever had the question asked. :Darrow: Or ever thought of it? :Bryan: I have been too busy on things that I thought were of more importance. :Darrow: You believe the story of the flood to be a literal interpretation? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: When was that flood? :Bryan: I would not attempt to fix the date. The date is fixed, as suggested this morning. :Darrow: About 4004 B. C. ?: Bryan: That has been the estimate of a man that is accepted today. [A witness had testified on Bishop Ussher's theory that the Earth was formed in 4004 B. C. ] I would not say it is accurate. :Darrow: That estimate is printed in the Bible? :Bryan: Everybody knows, at least, I think most of the people know, that was the estimate given. :Darrow: But what do you think that the Bible itself says? Don't you know how it was arrived at? :Bryan: I never made a calculation. :Darrow: A calculation from what? :Bryan: I could not say. :Darrow: From the generations of man? :Bryan: I would not want to say that. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think about things I don't think about. :Darrow: Do you think about things you do think about? :Bryan: Well, sometimes. (Laughter. ): Policeman Deputy Clason: Let us have order. . .: Thomas Stewart: {prosecution attorney}--Your honor, he is perfectly able to take care of this, but we are attaining no evidence. This is not competent evidence. :Bryan: These gentlemen have not had much chance--they did not come here to try this case. They came here to try revealed religion. I am here to defend it and they can ask me any question they please. :Judge: All right. (Applause. ): Darrow: Great applause from the bleachers. :Bryan: Darrow--I have never called them yokels. :Bryan: That is the ignorance of Tennessee, the bigotry. :Darrow: You mean who are applauding you? (Applause. ): Bryan: Those are the people whom you insult. :Darrow: You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does believe in your fool religion. :Judge: I will not stand for that. :Darrow: For what he is doing? :Judge: I am talking to both of you. :Darrow: Do you know anything about how many people there were in Egypt 3, 500 years ago, or how many people there were in China 5, 000 years ago? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Have you ever tried to find out? :Bryan: No, sir. You are the first man I ever heard of who has been interested in it. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, am I the first man you ever heard of who has been interested in the age of human societies and primitive man? :Bryan: You are the first man I ever heard speak of the number of people at those different periods. :Darrow: Where have you lived all your life? :Bryan: Not near you. (Laughter and applause. ): Darrow: Nor near anybody of learning? :Bryan: Oh, don't assume you know it all. :Darrow: Do you know there are thousands of books in our libraries on all those subjects I have been asking you about? :Bryan: I couldn't say, but I will take your word for it. . .: Darrow: Have you any idea how old the earth is? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The book you have introduced in evidence tells you, doesn't it? :Bryan: I don't think it does, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: Let's see whether it does; is this the one? :Bryan: That is the one, I think. :Darrow: It says B. C. 4004? :Bryan: That is Bishop Ussher's calculation. :Darrow: That is printed in the Bible you introduced? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: Would you say that the earth was only 4, 000 years old? :Bryan: Oh, no; I think it is much older than that. :Darrow: How much? :Bryan: I couldn't say. :Darrow: Do you say whether the Bible itself says it is older than that? :Bryan: I don't think it is older or not. :Darrow: Do you think the earth was made in six days? :Bryan: Not six days of 24 hours. :Darrow: Doesn't it say so? :Bryan: No, sir. :Judge: Are you about through, Mr. Darrow? :Darrow: I want to ask a few more questions about the creation. :Judge: I know. We are going to adjourn when Mr. Bryan comes off the stand for the day. Be very brief, Mr. Darrow. Of course, I believe I will make myself clearer. Of course, it is incompetent testimony before the jury. The only reason I am allowing this to go in at all is that they may have it in the appellate court as showing what the affidavit would be. :Bryan: The reason I am answering is not for the benefit of the superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him. :Darrow: I want to take an exception to this conduct of this witness. He may be very popular down here in the hills--: Bryan: Your honor, they have not asked a question legally and the only reason they have asked any question is for the purpose, as the question about Jonah was asked, for a chance to give this agnostic an opportunity to criticize a believer in the world of God; and I answered the question in order to shut his mouth so that he cannot go out and tell his atheistic friends that I would not answer his questions. That is the only reason, no more reason in the world. :Malone: (another defense counsel) Your honor on this very subject, I would like to say that I would have asked Mr. Bryan, and I consider myself as good a Christian as he is, every question that Mr. Darrow has asked him for the purpose of bringing out whether or not there is to be taken in this court a literal interpretation of the Bible, or whether, obviously, as these questions indicate, if a general and literal construction cannot be put upon the parts of the Bible which have been covered by Mr. Darrow's questions. I hope for the last time no further attempt will be made by counsel on the other side of the case, or Mr. Bryan, to say the defense is concerned at all with Mr. Darrow's particular religious views or lack of religious views. We are here as lawyers with the same right to our views. I have the same right to mine as a Christian as Mr. Bryan has to his, and we do not intend to have this case charged by Mr. Darrow's agnosticism or Mr. Bryan's brand of Christianity. (A great applause. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, do you believe that the first woman was Eve? :Bryan: Yes. :Darrow: Do you believe she was literally made out of Adam's rib? :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Did you ever discover where Cain got his wife? :Bryan: No, sir. I leave the agnostics to hunt for her. :Darrow: You have never found out? :Bryan: I have never tried to find out. :Darrow: You have never tried to find out? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The Bible says he got one, doesn't it? Were there other people on the earth at that time? :Bryan: I cannot say. :Darrow: You cannot say. Did that ever enter your consideration? :Bryan: Never bothered me. :Darrow: There were no others recorded, but Cain got a wife. :Bryan: That is what the Bible says. :Darrow: Where she came from you do not know. All right. Does the statement, \"The morning and the evening were the first day, \" and \"The morning and the evening were the second day, \" mean anything to you? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily means a 24-hour day. :Darrow: You do not? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: What do you consider it to be? :Bryan: I have not attempted to explain it. If you will take the second chapter--let me have the book. [Reaches for a Bible. ] The fourth verse of the second chapter says: \"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth, when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, \" the word day there in the very next chapter is used to describe a period. I do not see that there is any necessity for construing the words, \"the evening and the morning, \" as meaning necessarily a 24-hour day, \"in the day when the Lord made the heaven and the earth. \": Darrow: Then, when the Bible said, for instance, \"and God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day, \" that does not necessarily mean twenty-four hours? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily does. :Darrow: Do you think it does or does not? :Bryan: I know a great many think so. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think it does. :Darrow: You think those were not literal days? :Bryan: I do not think they were twenty-four-hour days. :Darrow: What do you think about it? :Bryan: That is my opinion--I do not know that my opinion is better on that subject than those who think it does. :Darrow: You do not think that? :Bryan: No. But I think it would be just as easy for the kind of God we believe in to make the earth in six days as in six years or in 6 million years or in 600 million years. I do not think it important whether we believe one or the other. :Darrow: Do you think those were literal days? :Bryan: My impression is they were periods, but I would not attempt to argue against anybody who wanted to believe in literal days. :Darrow: I will read it to you from the Bible: \"And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. \" Do you think that is why the serpent is compelled to crawl upon its belly? :Bryan: I believe that. :Darrow: Have you any idea how the snake went before that time? :Bryan: No, sir. :Darrow: Do you know whether he walked on his tail or not? :Bryan: No, sir. I have no way to know. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Now, you refer to the cloud that was put in heaven after the flood, the rainbow. Do you believe in that? :Bryan: Read it. :Darrow: All right, Mr. Bryan, I will read it for you. :Bryan: Your Honor, I think I can shorten this testimony. The only purpose Mr. Darrow has is to slur at the Bible, but I will answer his question. I will answer it all at once, and I have no objection in the world. I want the world to know that this man, who does not believe in a God, is trying to use a court in Tennessee to slur at it, and while it will require time, I am willing to take it. :Darrow: I object to your statement. I am examining you on your fool ideas that no intelligent Christian on earth believes. :Judge: Court is adjourned until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. :* Clarence Darrow's examination of William Jennings Bryan at the 1925 Scopes trial Scopes Trial Day 7   \n",

narrated theme of Sergei Bondarchuk's Soviet film adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, produced in 1966. In it the narrator declares \"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing\", although since the original is in Russian various translations to English are possible. This purported quote also bears resemblance to a quote misattributed to Plato (Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations) \"The penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men. \" It also bears resemblance to what Albert Einstein wrote as part of his tribute to Pablo Casals: \"The world is in greater peril from those who tolerate or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it. \": : More research done on this matter is available at these two links: Burkequote & Burkequote2 — as the information at these links indicates, there are many variants of this statement, probably because there is no known original by Burke.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We stand for a living wage. Wages are subnormal if they fail to provide a living for those who devote their time and energy to industrial occupations. The monetary equivalent of a living wage varies according to local conditions, but must include enough to secure the elements of a normal standard of living--a standard high enough to make morality possible, to provide for education and recreation, to care for immature members of the family, to maintain the family during periods of sickness, and to permit of reasonable saving for old age. Hours are excessive if they fail to afford the worker sufficient time to recuperate and return to his work thoroughly refreshed. We hold that the night labor of women and children is abnormal and should be prohibited; we hold that the employment of women over forty-eight hours per week is abnormal and should be prohibited. We hold that the seven day working week is abnormal, and we hold that one day of rest in seven should be provided in law. We hold that the continuous industries, operating twenty-four hours out of twenty-four, are abnormal, and where, because of public necessity or of technical reasons (such as molten metal), the twenty-four hours must be divided into two shifts of twelve hours or three shifts of eight, they should by law be divided into three of eight. Safety conditions are abnormal when, through unguarded machinery, poisons, electrical voltage, or otherwise, the workers are subjected to unnecessary hazards of life and limb; and all such occupations should come under governmental regulation and control. Home life is abnormal when tenement manufacture is carried on in the household. It is a serious menace to health, education, and childhood, and should therefore be entirely prohibited. Temporary construction camps are abnormal homes and should be subjected to governmental sanitary regulation. The premature employment of children is abnormal and should be prohibited; so also the employment of women in manufacturing, commerce, or other trades where work compels standing constantly; and also any employment of women in such trades for a period of at least eight weeks at time of childbirth. Our aim should be to secure conditions which will tend everywhere towards regular industry, and will do away with the necessity for rush periods, followed by out-of-work seasons, which put so severe a strain on wage-workers. It is abnormal for any industry to throw back upon the community the human wreckage due to its wear and tear, and the hazzards of sickness, accident, invalidism, involuntary unemployment, and old age should be provided for through insurance. This should be made a charge in whole or in part upon the industries the employer, the employee, and perhaps the people at large, to contribute severally in some degree. Wherever such standards are not met by given establishments, by given industries, are unprovided for by a legislature, or are balked by unenlightened courts, the workers are in jeopardy, the progressive employer is penalized, and the community pays a heavy cost in lessened efficiency and in misery. What Germany has done in the way of old age pensions or insurance should be studied by us, and the system adapted to our uses, with whatever modifications are rendered necessary by our different ways of life and habits of thought. Workingwomen have the same need to combine for protection that workingmen have; the ballot is as necessary for one class as for the other; we do not believe that with the two sexes there is identity of function; but we do believe that there should be equality of right; and therefore we favor woman suffrage. In those conservative States where there is genuine doubt how the women stand on this matter I suggest that it be referred to a vote of the women, so that they may themselves make the decision. Surely if women could vote, they would strengthen the hands of those who are endeavoring to deal in efficient fashion with evils such as the white slave traffic; evils which can in part be dealt with Nationally, but which in large part can be reached only by determined local action, such as insisting on the widespread publication of the names of the owners, the landlords, of houses used for immoral purposes. No people are more vitally interested than workingmen and workingwomen in questions affecting the public health. The pure food law must be strengthened and efficiently enforced. In the National Government one department should be intrusted with all the agencies relating to the public health, from the enforcement of the pure food law to the administration of quarantine. This department, through its special health service, would co-operate intelligently with the various State and municipal bodies established for the same end. There would be no discrimination against or for any one set of therapeutic methods, against or for any one school of medicine or system of healing; the aim would be merely to secure under one administrative body efficient sanitary regulation in the interest of the people as a whole.   \n",

revolution came in Germany, I looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but, no, the universities immediately were silenced. Then I looked to the great editors of the newspapers whose flaming editorials in days gone by had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks. Then I looked to individual writers who, as literary guides of Germany, had written much and often concerning the place of freedom in modern life; but they, too, were mute. Only the church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly. :: In his original statement Einstein was probably referring to the actions of the Emergency Covenant of Pastors organized by Martin Niemöller, and the Confessing Church which he and other prominent churchmen such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer established in opposition to Nazi policies. :: Einstein also made some scathingly negative comments about the behavior of the Church under the Nazi regime (and its behavior towards Jews throughout history) in a 1943 conversation with William Hermanns recorded in Hermanns' book Einstein and the Poet (1983). On p. 63 Hermanns records him saying \"Never in history has violence been so widespread as in Nazi Germany. The concentration camps make the actions of Genghis Khan look like child's play. But what makes me shudder is that the Church is silent. One doesn't need to be a prophet to say, 'The Catholic Church will pay for this silence. ' Dr. Hermanns, you will live to see that there is moral law in the universe. . .There are cosmic laws, Dr. Hermanns. They cannot be bribed by prayers or incense. What an insult to the principles of creation. But remember, that for God a thousand years is a day. This power maneuver of the Church, these Concordats through the centuries with worldly powers. . the Church has to pay for it. We live now in a scientific age and in a psychological age. You are a sociologist, aren't you? You know what the Herdenmenschen (men of herd mentality) can do when they are organized and have a leader, especially if he is a spokesmen for the Church. I do not say that the unspeakable crimes of the Church for 2000 years had always the blessings of the Vatican, but it vaccinated its believers with the idea: We have the true God, and the Jews have crucified Him. The Church sowed hate instead of love, though the Ten Commandments state: Thou shalt not kill. \" And then on p. 64: \"I'm not a Communist but I can well understand why they destroyed the Church in Russia. All the wrongs come home, as the proverb says. The Church will pay for its dealings with Hitler, and Germany, too. \" And on p. 65: \"I don't like to implant in youth the Church's doctrine of a personal God, because that Church has behaved so inhumanely in the past 2000 years. The fear of punishment makes the people march. Consider the hate the Church manifested against the Jews and then against the Muslims, the Crusades with their crimes, the burning stakes of the Inquisition, the tacit consent of Hitler's actions while the Jews and the Poles dug their own graves and were slaughtered. And Hitler is said to have been an altar boy! The truly religious man has no fear of life and no fear of death—and certainly no blind faith; his faith must be in his conscience. . . I am therefore against all organized religion. Too often in history, men have followed the cry of battle rather than the cry of truth. \" When Hermanns asked him \"Isn't it only human to move along the line of least resistance? \", Einstein responded \"Yes. It is indeed human, as proved by Cardinal Pacelli, who was behind the Concordat with Hitler. Since when can one make a pact with Christ and Satan at the same time? And he is now the Pope! The moment I hear the word 'religion', my hair stands on end. The Church has always sold itself to those in power, and agreed to any bargain in return for immunity. It would have been fine if the spirit of religion had guided the Church; instead, the Church determined the spirit of religion. Churchmen through the ages have fought political and institutional corruption very little, so long as their own sanctity and church property were preserved. \"   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                    In those days I had seen little further than the old school of political economists into the possibilities of fundamental improvement in social arrangements. Private property, as now understood, and inheritance, appeared to me, as to them, the dernier mot of legislation: and I looked no further than to mitigating the inequalities consequent on these institutions, by getting rid of primogeniture and entails. The notion that it was possible to go further than this in removing the injustice—for injustice it is, whether admitting of a complete remedy or not—involved in the fact that some are born to riches and the vast majority to poverty, I then reckoned chimerical, and only hoped that by universal education, leading to voluntary restraint on population, the portion of the poor might be made more tolerable. In short, I was a democrat, but not the least of a Socialist. We were now much less democrats than I had been, because so long as education continues to be so wretchedly imperfect, we dreaded the ignorance and especially the selfishness and brutality of the mass: but our ideal of ultimate improvement went far beyond Democracy, and would class us decidedly under the general designation of Socialists. While we repudiated with the greatest energy that tyranny of society over the individual which most Socialistic systems are supposed to involve, we yet looked forward to a time when society will no longer be divided into the idle and the industrious; when the rule that they who do not work shall not eat, will be applied not to paupers only, but impartially to all; when the division of the produce of labour, instead of depending, as in so great a degree it now does, on the accident of birth, will be made by concert on an acknowledged principle of justice; and when it will no longer either be, or be thought to be, impossible for human beings to exert themselves strenuously in procuring benefits which are not to be exclusively their own, but to be shared with the society they belong to. The social problem of the future we considered to be, how to unite the greatest individual liberty of action, with a common ownership in the raw material of the globe, and an equal participation of all in the benefits of combined labour. We had not the presumption to suppose that we could already foresee, by what precise form of institutions these objects could most effectually be attained, or at how near or how distant a period they would become practicable. We saw clearly that to render any such social transformation either possible or desirable, an equivalent change of character must take place both in the uncultivated herd who now compose the labouring masses, and in the immense majority of their employers. Both these classes must learn by practice to labour and combine for generous, or at all events for public and social purposes, and not, as hitherto, solely for narrowly interested ones. But the capacity to do this has always existed in mankind, and is not, nor is ever likely to be, extinct. Education, habit, and the cultivation of the sentiments, will make a common man dig or weave for his country, as readily as fight for his country. True enough, it is only by slow degrees, and a system of culture prolonged through successive generations, that men in general can be brought up to this point. But the hindrance is not in the essential constitution of human nature. Interest in the common good is at present so weak a motive in the generality not because it can never be otherwise, but because the mind is not accustomed to dwell on it as it dwells from morning till night on things which tend only to personal advantage. When called into activity, as only self-interest now is, by the daily course of life, and spurred from behind by the love of distinction and the fear of shame, it is capable of producing, even in common men, the most strenuous exertions as well as the most heroic sacrifices. The deep-rooted selfishness which forms the general character of the existing state of society, is so deeply rooted, only because the whole course of existing institutions tends to foster it; modern institutions in some respects more than ancient, since the occasions on which the individual is called on to do anything for the public without receiving its pay, are far less frequent in modern life, than the smaller commonwealths of antiquity.   \n",

They closely resemble remarks known to have been made by the Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill, in an address at the University of St. Andrews (1 February 1867): Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. The very extensively used remarks attributed to Burke might be based on a paraphrase of some of his ideas, but he is not known to have ever declared them in so succinct a manner in any of his writings. It has been suggested that they may have been adapted from these lines of Burke's in his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents (1770): \"When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle. \" (see above)   \n",

       "424    Attributed in \"The Conflict Between Church And State In The Third Reich\", by S. Parkes Cadman, La Crosse Tribune and Leader-Press (28 October 1934), viewable online on p. 9 of the issue here (double-click the page to zoom). The quote is preceded by \"In this connection it is worth quoting in free translation a statement made by Professor Einstein last year to one of my colleagues who has been prominently identified with the Protestant church in its contacts with Germany. \" [Emphasis added. ] While based on something that Einstein said, Einstein himself stated that the quote was not an accurate record of his words or opinion. After the quote appeared in Time magazine (23 December 1940), p. 38, a minister in Harbor Springs, Michigan wrote to Einstein to check if the quote was real. Einstein wrote back \"It is true that I made a statement which corresponds approximately with the text you quoted. I made this statement during the first years of the Nazi-Regime — much earlier than 1940 — and my expressions were a little more moderate. \" (March 1943) In a later letter to Rev. Cornelius Greenway of Brooklyn, who asked if Einstein would write out the statement in his own hand, Einstein was more vehement in his repudiation of the statement (14 November 1950): The wording of the statement you have quoted is not my own. Shortly after Hitler came to power in Germany I had an oral conversation with a newspaper man about these matters. Since then my remarks have been elaborated and exaggerated nearly beyond recognition. I cannot in good conscience write down the statement you sent me as my own. The matter is all the more embarrassing to me because I, like yourself, I am predominantly critical concerning the activities, and especially the political activities, through history of the official clergy. Thus, my former statement, even if reduced to my actual words (which I do not remember in detail) gives a wrong impression of my general attitude.   \n",

       "      <td>\"Einstein's famous saying in Copenhagen\", as quoted in a FBIS Daily Report: East Europe (4 April 1995), p. 45 May have originated from Einstein's 25 May 1946 telegram quoted in this New York Times story, where he wrote \"The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe\", along with a later comment \"We need two hundred thousand dollars at once for a nation-wide campaign to let the people know that a new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels. \" The 1959 English translation of Hans Hellmut Kirst's The Seventh Day modified the two quotes and left out the intermediate part about funding for a nation-wide campaign: \"The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything except our ways of thinking. Thus we are drifting toward a catastrophe beyond comparison. We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive\" (the original German version from 1957, titled Keinner Kommt Davon, has the quote as \"Die entfesselte Macht des Atoms hat alles verändert, nur nicht unsere Denkweisen. Auf diese Weise gleiten wir einer Katastrophe ohnegleichen entgegen. Wir brauchen eine wesentlich neue Denkungsart, wenn die Menschheit am Leben bleiben soll. \") This version is quoted verbatim in later sources like p. 23 of a statement given by Dr. Charles E. Osgood to the US Committee on Foreign relations on 25 May 1966, and a March 1979 story on p. 82 of The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. Some also gave shortened versions which omitted the reference to \"the unleashed power of the atom\", as in the 1967 English translation of Josué de Castro's 1961 book The Black Book of Hunger, which on p. 4 attributed to Einstein the quote \"It has become essential that mankind formulate a new mode of thinking if it wishes to survive and to reach a higher level. \" Ram Dass' 1974 book The Only Dance There Is, which consisted of transcripts of talks he had given in 1970 and 1972, on p. 38 attributed to Einstein the quote \"The world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level as the level we created them at. \" Ram Dass' speeches were generally given without notes so he may have just been paraphrasing one of the earlier versions of the quote, but some later sources repeated this exactly or with only a word or two different, like p. 291 of David Dellinger's 1975 book More Power Than We Know, or p. 136 of the 1977 book The End of the Road: A Citizen's Guide to Transportation Problem-Solving edited by Robert Golten et al. , or p. 47 of the 1986 edition of James L. Christian's book Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering. Later authors gave shorter variants, like The 1986 Annual: Developing Human Resources which on p. 185 attributed to Einstein the statement \"Our thinking has created problems which cannot be solved by that same level of thinking\", or the 1988 book Take This Job and Love It by Dennis Jaffe and Cynthia Scott which on p. 60 attributed the quote \"the significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them\" (a nearly identical version with 'we face' instead of 'we have' can be found on p. 42 of Stephen Covey's 1989 book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People), and the 1989 book Living in Love With Yourself by Barry Ellsworth, which on p. 27 attributed the quote \"the problems our world faces can never be solved by the same type of thinking that created them\", and Lynne Garnett's 1990 book Finding the Great Creative You: A Seven Step Adventure which on p. 168 attributed the quote \"You can't solve a problem using the same kind of thinking that got you into the problem in the first place. \" An August 1993 post from alt. quotations on Usenet uses the wording \"We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them\" (the earliest example found which includes the phrase 'using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them' as in the 1995 FBIS quote above), though the author, Peter Capek, says this is just a rough memory of the quote being asked about; this exact wording was repeated in many later posts, with one of the earliest from October 1993 citing Peter Capek as the source.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As discussed in this entry from The Quote Investigator, the earliest published attribution of a similar quote to Einstein seems to have been in Gestalt therapist Frederick S. Perls' 1969 book Gestalt Theory Verbatim, where he wrote on p. 33: \"As Albert Einstein once said to me: 'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity. ' But what is much more widespread than the actual stupidity is the playing stupid, turning off your ear, not listening, not seeing. \" Perls also offered another variant in his 1972 book In and Out the Garbage Pail, where he mentioned a meeting with Einstein and on p. 52 quoted him saying: \"Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I am not yet completely sure about the universe. \" However, Perls had given yet another variant of this quote in an earlier book, Ego, Hunger, and Aggression: a Revision of Freud's Theory and Method (originally published 1942, although the Quote Investigator only checked that the quote appeared in the 1947 edition), where he attributed it not to Einstein but to a \"great astronomer\", writing: \"As modern times promote hasty eating to a large extent, it is not surprising to learn that a great astronomer said: 'Two things are infinite, as far as we know – the universe and human stupidity. ' To-day we know that this statement is not quite correct. Einstein has proved that the universe is limited. \" So, the later attributions in 1969 and 1972 may have been a case of faulty memory, or of intentionally trying to increase the authority of the quote by attributing it to Einstein. The quote itself may be a variant of a similar quote attributed even earlier to the philosopher Ernest Renan, found for example in The Public: Volume 18 from 1915, which says on p. 1126: \"He quotes the saying of Renan: it isn't the stars that give him an idea of infinity; it is man's stupidity. \" (Other examples of similar attributions to Renan can be found on this Google Books search. ) Renan was French so this is presumably intended as a translation, but different sources give different versions of the supposed original French quote, such as \"La bêtise humaine est la seule chose qui donne une idée de l'infini\" (found for example in Réflexions sur la vie, 1895-1898 by Remy de Gourmont from 1903, p. 103, along with several other early sources as seen in this search) and \"Ce n'est pas l'immensité de la voûte étoilée qui peut donner le plus complétement l'idée de l'infini, mais bien la bêtise humaine! \" (found in Broad views, Volume 2 from 1904, p. 465). Since these variants have not been found in Renan's own writings, they may represent false attributions as well. They may also be variants of an even older saying; for example, the 1880 book Des vers by Guy de Maupassant includes on p. 9 a quote from a letter (dated February 19, 1880) by Gustave Flaubert where Flaubert writes \"Cependant, qui sait? La terre a des limites, mais la bêtise humaine est infinie! \" which translates to \"But who knows? The earth has its boundaries, but human stupidity is infinite! \" Similarly the 1887 book Melanges by Jules-Paul Tardivel includes on p. 273 a piece said to have been written in 1880 in which he writes \"Aujourd'hui je sais qu'il n'y a pas de limites à la bêtise humaine, qu'elle est infinie\" which translates to \"today I know that there is no limit to human stupidity, it is infinite. \" Variant: \"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former. \" Earliest version located is in Technocracy digest: Issues 287–314 from 1988, p. 76. Translated to German as: \"Zwei Dinge sind unendlich: das Universum und die menschliche Dummheit. Aber beim Universum bin ich mir nicht ganz sicher. \" (Earliest version located - \"Zwei Dinge sind unendlich, das Universum und die menschliche Dummheit. . Und beim Universum bin ich mir noch keineswegs sicher\" - in Hans Askenasy: Sind wir alle Nazis? Zum Potential der Unmenschlichkeit, Campus Verlag Frankfurt/Main 1979, p. 153 books. google. )</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Chinese people have come to see the sharp contrast between the Liberated Areas and the Kuomintang areas. Are not the facts clear enough? Here are two lines, the line of a people's war and the line of passive resistance, which is against a people's war; one leads to victory even in the difficult conditions in China's Liberated Areas with their total lack of outside aid, and the other leads to defeat even in the extremely favourable conditions in the Kuomintang areas with foreign aid available. The Kuomintang government attributes its failures to lack of arms. Yet one may ask, which of the two are short of arms, the Kuomintang troops or the troops of the Liberated Areas? Of all China's forces, those of the Liberated Areas lack arms most acutely, their only weapons being those they capture from the enemy or manufacture under the most adverse conditions. Is it not true that the forces directly under the Kuomintang central government are far better armed than the provincial troops? Yet in combat effectiveness most of the central forces are inferior to the provincial troops. The Kuomintang commands vast reserves of manpower, yet its wrong recruiting policy makes manpower replenishment very difficult. Though cut off from each other by the enemy and engaged in constant fighting, China's Liberated Areas are able to mobilize inexhaustible manpower because the militia and self-defence corps system, which is well-adapted to the needs of the people, is applied everywhere, and because misuse and waste of manpower are avoided. Although the Kuomintang controls vast areas abounding in grain and the people supply it with 70-100 million tan annually, its army is always short of food and its soldiers are emaciated because the greater part of the grain is embezzled by those through whose hands it passes. But although most of China's Liberated Areas, which are located in the enemy rear, have been devastated by the enemy's policy of \"burn all, kill all, loot all\", and although some regions like northern Shensi are very arid, we have successfully solved the grain problem through our own efforts by increasing agricultural production. The Kuomintang areas are facing a very grave economic crisis; most industries are bankrupt, and even such necessities as cloth have to be imported from the United States. But China's Liberated Areas are able to meet their own needs in cloth and other necessities through the development of industry. In the Kuomintang areas, the workers, peasants, shop assistants, government employees, intellectuals and cultural workers live in extreme misery. In the Liberated Areas all the people have food, clothing and work. It is characteristic of the Kuomintang areas that, exploiting the national crisis for profiteering purposes, officials have concurrently become traders and habitual grafters without any sense of shame or decency. It is characteristic of China's Liberated Areas that, setting an example of plain living and hard work, the cadres take part in production in addition to their regular duties; honesty is held in high esteem while graft is strictly prohibited. In the Kuomintang areas the people have no freedom at all. In China's Liberated Areas the people have full freedom. Who is to blame for all the anomalies which confront the Kuomintang rulers? Are others to blame, or they themselves? Are foreign countries to blame for not giving them enough aid, or are the Kuomintang government's dictatorial rule, corruption and incompetence to blame? Isn't the answer obvious?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Heisenberg recounts a personal conversation he had with Pauli and Bohr in 1952 in which Bohr says, \"Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it. \" Heisenberg, Werner, Physics and Beyond. (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971) p. 206. Bohr said this sentence in a conversation with Werner Heisenberg, as quoted in: \"Der Teil und das Ganze. Gespräche im Umkreis der Atomphysik\". R. Piper &amp; Co. , München, 1969, S. 280. DIE ZEIT 22. Aug. 1969. As quoted in Meeting the Universe Halfway (2007) by Karen Michelle Barad, p. 254, with the quote attributed to The Philosophical Writings of Niels Bohr, but with no page number or volume number given. David Mermin, on pages 186–187 of his book Boojums All the Way Through: Communicating Science in a Prosaic Age (1990) noted that he specifically looked for pithy quotes about quantum mechanics along these lines when reviewing the three volumes of The Philosophical Writings of Niels Bohr, but couldn't find any: Once I tried to teach some quantum mechanics to a class of law students, philosophers, and art historians. As an advertisement for the course I put together the most sensational quotations I could collect from the most authoritative practitioners of the subject. Heisenberg was a goldmine: \"The concept of the objective reality of the elementary particles has thus evaporated. . \"; \"the idea of an objective real world whose smallest parts exist objectively in the same sense as stones or trees exist, independently of whether or not we observe them. . is impossible. . \" Feynman did his part too: \"I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics. \" But I failed to turn up anything comparable in the writings of Bohr. Others attributed spectacular remarks to him, but he seemed to take pains to avoid any hint of the dramatic in his own writings. You don't pack them into your classroom with \"The indivisibility of quantum phenomena finds its consequent expression in the circumstance that every definable subdivision would require a change of the experimental arrangement with the appearance of new individual phenomena, \" or \"the wider frame of complementarity directly expresses our position as regards the account of fundamental properties of matter presupposed in classical physical description but outside its scope. \"I was therefore on the lookout for nuggets when I sat down to review these three volumes – a reissue of Bohr's collected essays on the revolutionary epistemological character of the quantum theory and on the implications of that revolution for other scientific and non-scientific areas of endeavor (the originals first appeared in 1934, 1958, and 1963. ) But the most radical statement I could find in all three books was this: \". . physics is to be regarded not so much as the study of something a priori given, but rather as the development of methods for ordering and surveying human experience. \" No nuggets for the nonscientist. Variants: Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum mechanics cannot possibly have understood it. Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it. Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood a single word. If you think you can talk about quantum theory without feeling dizzy, you haven't understood the first thing about it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Etymology is a science in which vowels signify nothing at all, and consonants very little. Investigations of the comment include: Jan Noordegraaf (1997) \"Multatuli, Voltaire en de etymologie\" in Voorlopig verleden. Taalkundige plaatsbepalingen 1797-1960 (Münster: Nodus Publikationen) pp. 212-214 (). John Considine (January 2009) \"Les voyelles ne font rien, et les consonnes fort peu de chose\": On the history of Voltaire's supposed comment on etymology\" Historiographia Linguistica Volume 36, Issue 1, pp. 181-189; Garson O'Toole (25 March 2019) \"In Etymology Vowels Count for Nothing and Consonants for Very Little\" Quote Investigator From these, the earliest version found is already attributed to Voltaire: August Wilhelm von Schlegel (Part 1) of \"Review of 'Altdeutsche Wälder' vol. 1 by the Grimm brothers (Cassel 1813)\" (1815) Heidelberger Jahrbücher der Literatur no. 46 pp. 734-5 Mit solchen Allgemeinsätzen kann man Alles erkünsteln, und macht am Ende die Etymologie zu einer Wissenschaft, wobei, wie Voltaire sagt, die Vokale für gar nichts, die Konsonanten für wenig gerechnet werden. With such generalities one can artificialize everything, and in the end turn etymology into a science in which, as Voltaire says, the vowels are reckoned for nothing, the consonants for little. The earliest French version has singular voyelle / consonne: Anonymous (October 1833) \"Art. VII. -Grimm's Deutche Grammatik. Gottingen. 1822-1831. 3 vols\", The Quarterly Review (John Murray, London) volume 50 p. 169: It is in works of this nature that Germany is pre-eminent among the European nations; and it is long since those who are interested in philological researches have made a more valuable acquisition, or one more fit to wipe out from their favourite study the reproach which has been somewhat speciously cast on it, that it is a science 'où la voyelle ne fait rien, et la consonne fort peu de chose. ' Friedrich Max Müller ascribes the same French to Voltaire in October 1851: \"Review of Franz Bopp, Comparative Grammar of the Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Gothic, German, and Sclavonic Languages, transl. by Edward Backhouse Eastwick\" Edinburgh Review v. 94, no. CXCII p. 298 Müller gives the plural voyelles / consonnes version in 1864 \"Lecture VI: On the Principles of Etymology\" Lectures on the Science of Language; Second Series (London: Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green) p. 238 Leonard Bloomfield (1933) Language (New York: Henry Holt) cites Muller 1864. (s. 1. 3 p. 6 and Notes p. 511) Pierre Guiraud (1979) [1972] L'étymologie Que sais-je? vol. 1122 (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France) 4th ed. p. 24 says that Voltaire's quote specifically refers to the etymologies in Gilles Ménage's Les Origines de la langue françoise (1650; expanded in 1670 as Dictionnaire Etymologique). Guiraud prepends the etymology quote to an actual quote from Voltaire's Histoire de l'empire de Russie sous Pierre le Grand. . Il est donc incontestable que l'empereur Yu prit son nom de Menés, roi d'Égypte, et l'empereur Ki est évidemment le roi Atoës en changeant k en a et i en toës. :. . which mocks Joseph de Guignes (1760) Mémoire dans lequel on prouve que les Chinois sont une colonie égyptienne.</td>\n",

       "8363   中国人民从中国解放区和国民党统治区，获得了明显的比较。难道还不明显吗？两条路线，人民战争的路线和反对人民战争的消极抗日的路线，其结果：一条是胜利的，即使处在中国解放区这种环境恶劣和毫无外援的地位；另一条是失败的，即使处在国民党统治区这种极端有利和取得外国接济的地位。国民党政府把自己的失败归咎于缺乏武器。但是试问：缺乏武器的是国民党的军队呢，还是解放区的军队？中国解放区的军队是中国军队中武器最缺乏的军队，他们只能从敌人手里夺取武器和在最恶劣条件下自己制造武器。国民党中央系军队的武器，不是比起地方系军队来要好得多吗？但是比起战斗力来，中央系却多数劣于地方系。国民党拥有广大的人力资源，但是在它的错误的兵役政策下，人力补充却极端困难。中国解放区处在被敌人分割和战斗频繁的情况之下，因为普遍实施了适合人民需要的民兵和自卫军制度，又防止了对于人力资源的滥用和浪费，人力动员却可以源源不竭。国民党拥有粮食丰富的广大地区，人民每年供给它七千万至一万万市担的粮食，但是大部分被经手人员中饱了，致使国民党的军队经常缺乏粮食，士兵饿得面黄肌瘦。中国解放区的主要部分隔在敌后，遭受敌人烧杀抢\"三光\"政策的摧残，其中有些是像陕北这样贫瘠的区域，但是却能用自己动手、发展农业生产的方法，很好地解决了粮食问题。国民党区域经济危机极端严重，工业大部分破产了，连布匹这样的日用品也要从美国运来。中国解放区却能用发展工业的方法，自己解决布匹和其他日用品的需要。在国民党区域，工人、农民、店员、公务人员、知识分子以及文化工作者，生活痛苦，达于极点。中国解放区的全体人民都有饭吃，有衣穿，有事做。利用抗战发国难财，官吏即商人，贪污成风，廉耻扫地，这是国民党区域的特色之一。艰苦奋斗，以身作则，工作之外，还要生产，奖励廉洁，禁绝贪污，这是中国解放区的特色之一。国民党区域剥夺人民的一切自由。中国解放区则给予人民以充分的自由。国民党统治者面前摆着这些反常的状况，怪谁呢？怪别人，还是怪他们自己呢？怪外国缺少援助，还是怪国民党政府的独裁统治和腐败无能呢？这难道还不明白吗？   \n",

       "419    \"Einstein's famous saying in Copenhagen\", as quoted in a FBIS Daily Report: East Europe (4 April 1995), p. 45 May have originated from Einstein's 25 May 1946 telegram quoted in this New York Times story, where he wrote \"The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe\", along with a later comment \"We need two hundred thousand dollars at once for a nation-wide campaign to let the people know that a new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels. \" The 1959 English translation of Hans Hellmut Kirst's The Seventh Day modified the two quotes and left out the intermediate part about funding for a nation-wide campaign: \"The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything except our ways of thinking. Thus we are drifting toward a catastrophe beyond comparison. We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive\" (the original German version from 1957, titled Keinner Kommt Davon, has the quote as \"Die entfesselte Macht des Atoms hat alles verändert, nur nicht unsere Denkweisen. Auf diese Weise gleiten wir einer Katastrophe ohnegleichen entgegen. Wir brauchen eine wesentlich neue Denkungsart, wenn die Menschheit am Leben bleiben soll. \") This version is quoted verbatim in later sources like p. 23 of a statement given by Dr. Charles E. Osgood to the US Committee on Foreign relations on 25 May 1966, and a March 1979 story on p. 82 of The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. Some also gave shortened versions which omitted the reference to \"the unleashed power of the atom\", as in the 1967 English translation of Josué de Castro's 1961 book The Black Book of Hunger, which on p. 4 attributed to Einstein the quote \"It has become essential that mankind formulate a new mode of thinking if it wishes to survive and to reach a higher level. \" Ram Dass' 1974 book The Only Dance There Is, which consisted of transcripts of talks he had given in 1970 and 1972, on p. 38 attributed to Einstein the quote \"The world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level as the level we created them at. \" Ram Dass' speeches were generally given without notes so he may have just been paraphrasing one of the earlier versions of the quote, but some later sources repeated this exactly or with only a word or two different, like p. 291 of David Dellinger's 1975 book More Power Than We Know, or p. 136 of the 1977 book The End of the Road: A Citizen's Guide to Transportation Problem-Solving edited by Robert Golten et al. , or p. 47 of the 1986 edition of James L. Christian's book Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering. Later authors gave shorter variants, like The 1986 Annual: Developing Human Resources which on p. 185 attributed to Einstein the statement \"Our thinking has created problems which cannot be solved by that same level of thinking\", or the 1988 book Take This Job and Love It by Dennis Jaffe and Cynthia Scott which on p. 60 attributed the quote \"the significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them\" (a nearly identical version with 'we face' instead of 'we have' can be found on p. 42 of Stephen Covey's 1989 book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People), and the 1989 book Living in Love With Yourself by Barry Ellsworth, which on p. 27 attributed the quote \"the problems our world faces can never be solved by the same type of thinking that created them\", and Lynne Garnett's 1990 book Finding the Great Creative You: A Seven Step Adventure which on p. 168 attributed the quote \"You can't solve a problem using the same kind of thinking that got you into the problem in the first place. \" An August 1993 post from alt. quotations on Usenet uses the wording \"We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them\" (the earliest example found which includes the phrase 'using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them' as in the 1995 FBIS quote above), though the author, Peter Capek, says this is just a rough memory of the quote being asked about; this exact wording was repeated in many later posts, with one of the earliest from October 1993 citing Peter Capek as the source.   \n",
       "417                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         As discussed in this entry from The Quote Investigator, the earliest published attribution of a similar quote to Einstein seems to have been in Gestalt therapist Frederick S. Perls' 1969 book Gestalt Theory Verbatim, where he wrote on p. 33: \"As Albert Einstein once said to me: 'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity. ' But what is much more widespread than the actual stupidity is the playing stupid, turning off your ear, not listening, not seeing. \" Perls also offered another variant in his 1972 book In and Out the Garbage Pail, where he mentioned a meeting with Einstein and on p. 52 quoted him saying: \"Two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I am not yet completely sure about the universe. \" However, Perls had given yet another variant of this quote in an earlier book, Ego, Hunger, and Aggression: a Revision of Freud's Theory and Method (originally published 1942, although the Quote Investigator only checked that the quote appeared in the 1947 edition), where he attributed it not to Einstein but to a \"great astronomer\", writing: \"As modern times promote hasty eating to a large extent, it is not surprising to learn that a great astronomer said: 'Two things are infinite, as far as we know – the universe and human stupidity. ' To-day we know that this statement is not quite correct. Einstein has proved that the universe is limited. \" So, the later attributions in 1969 and 1972 may have been a case of faulty memory, or of intentionally trying to increase the authority of the quote by attributing it to Einstein. The quote itself may be a variant of a similar quote attributed even earlier to the philosopher Ernest Renan, found for example in The Public: Volume 18 from 1915, which says on p. 1126: \"He quotes the saying of Renan: it isn't the stars that give him an idea of infinity; it is man's stupidity. \" (Other examples of similar attributions to Renan can be found on this Google Books search. ) Renan was French so this is presumably intended as a translation, but different sources give different versions of the supposed original French quote, such as \"La bêtise humaine est la seule chose qui donne une idée de l'infini\" (found for example in Réflexions sur la vie, 1895-1898 by Remy de Gourmont from 1903, p. 103, along with several other early sources as seen in this search) and \"Ce n'est pas l'immensité de la voûte étoilée qui peut donner le plus complétement l'idée de l'infini, mais bien la bêtise humaine! \" (found in Broad views, Volume 2 from 1904, p. 465). Since these variants have not been found in Renan's own writings, they may represent false attributions as well. They may also be variants of an even older saying; for example, the 1880 book Des vers by Guy de Maupassant includes on p. 9 a quote from a letter (dated February 19, 1880) by Gustave Flaubert where Flaubert writes \"Cependant, qui sait? La terre a des limites, mais la bêtise humaine est infinie! \" which translates to \"But who knows? The earth has its boundaries, but human stupidity is infinite! \" Similarly the 1887 book Melanges by Jules-Paul Tardivel includes on p. 273 a piece said to have been written in 1880 in which he writes \"Aujourd'hui je sais qu'il n'y a pas de limites à la bêtise humaine, qu'elle est infinie\" which translates to \"today I know that there is no limit to human stupidity, it is infinite. \" Variant: \"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former. \" Earliest version located is in Technocracy digest: Issues 287–314 from 1988, p. 76. Translated to German as: \"Zwei Dinge sind unendlich: das Universum und die menschliche Dummheit. Aber beim Universum bin ich mir nicht ganz sicher. \" (Earliest version located - \"Zwei Dinge sind unendlich, das Universum und die menschliche Dummheit. .

Are not the facts clear enough? Here are two lines, the line of a people's war and the line of passive resistance, which is against a people's war; one leads to victory even in the difficult conditions in China's Liberated Areas with their total lack of outside aid, and the other leads to defeat even in the extremely favourable conditions in the Kuomintang areas with foreign aid available. The Kuomintang government attributes its failures to lack of arms. Yet one may ask, which of the two are short of arms, the Kuomintang troops or the troops of the Liberated Areas? Of all China's forces, those of the Liberated Areas lack arms most acutely, their only weapons being those they capture from the enemy or manufacture under the most adverse conditions. Is it not true that the forces directly under the Kuomintang central government are far better armed than the provincial troops? Yet in combat effectiveness most of the central forces are inferior to the provincial troops. The Kuomintang commands vast reserves of manpower, yet its wrong recruiting policy makes manpower replenishment very difficult. Though cut off from each other by the enemy and engaged in constant fighting, China's Liberated Areas are able to mobilize inexhaustible manpower because the militia and self-defence corps system, which is well-adapted to the needs of the people, is applied everywhere, and because misuse and waste of manpower are avoided. Although the Kuomintang controls vast areas abounding in grain and the people supply it with 70-100 million tan annually, its army is always short of food and its soldiers are emaciated because the greater part of the grain is embezzled by those through whose hands it passes. But although most of China's Liberated Areas, which are located in the enemy rear, have been devastated by the enemy's policy of \"burn all, kill all, loot all\", and although some regions like northern Shensi are very arid, we have successfully solved the grain problem through our own efforts by increasing agricultural production. The Kuomintang areas are facing a very grave economic crisis; most industries are bankrupt, and even such necessities as cloth have to be imported from the United States. But China's Liberated Areas are able to meet their own needs in cloth and other necessities through the development of industry. In the Kuomintang areas, the workers, peasants, shop assistants, government employees, intellectuals and cultural workers live in extreme misery. In the Liberated Areas all the people have food, clothing and work. It is characteristic of the Kuomintang areas that, exploiting the national crisis for profiteering purposes, officials have concurrently become traders and habitual grafters without any sense of shame or decency. It is characteristic of China's Liberated Areas that, setting an example of plain living and hard work, the cadres take part in production in addition to their regular duties; honesty is held in high esteem while graft is strictly prohibited. In the Kuomintang areas the people have no freedom at all. In China's Liberated Areas the people have full freedom. Who is to blame for all the anomalies which confront the Kuomintang rulers? Are others to blame, or they themselves? Are foreign countries to blame for not giving them enough aid, or are the Kuomintang government's dictatorial rule, corruption and incompetence to blame? Isn't the answer obvious?   \n",

(New York: Harper & Row, 1971) p. 206. Bohr said this sentence in a conversation with Werner Heisenberg, as quoted in: \"Der Teil und das Ganze. Gespräche im Umkreis der Atomphysik\". R. Piper & Co. , München, 1969, S. 280. DIE ZEIT 22. Aug. 1969. As quoted in Meeting the Universe Halfway (2007) by Karen Michelle Barad, p. 254, with the quote attributed to The Philosophical Writings of Niels Bohr, but with no page number or volume number given. David Mermin, on pages 186–187 of his book Boojums All the Way Through: Communicating Science in a Prosaic Age (1990) noted that he specifically looked for pithy quotes about quantum mechanics along these lines when reviewing the three volumes of The Philosophical Writings of Niels Bohr, but couldn't find any: Once I tried to teach some quantum mechanics to a class of law students, philosophers, and art historians. As an advertisement for the course I put together the most sensational quotations I could collect from the most authoritative practitioners of the subject. Heisenberg was a goldmine: \"The concept of the objective reality of the elementary particles has thus evaporated. . \"; \"the idea of an objective real world whose smallest parts exist objectively in the same sense as stones or trees exist, independently of whether or not we observe them. . is impossible. . \" Feynman did his part too: \"I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics. \" But I failed to turn up anything comparable in the writings of Bohr. Others attributed spectacular remarks to him, but he seemed to take pains to avoid any hint of the dramatic in his own writings. You don't pack them into your classroom with \"The indivisibility of quantum phenomena finds its consequent expression in the circumstance that every definable subdivision would require a change of the experimental arrangement with the appearance of new individual phenomena, \" or \"the wider frame of complementarity directly expresses our position as regards the account of fundamental properties of matter presupposed in classical physical description but outside its scope. \"I was therefore on the lookout for nuggets when I sat down to review these three volumes – a reissue of Bohr's collected essays on the revolutionary epistemological character of the quantum theory and on the implications of that revolution for other scientific and non-scientific areas of endeavor (the originals first appeared in 1934, 1958, and 1963. ) But the most radical statement I could find in all three books was this: \". . physics is to be regarded not so much as the study of something a priori given, but rather as the development of methods for ordering and surveying human experience. \" No nuggets for the nonscientist. Variants: Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum mechanics cannot possibly have understood it. Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it. Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood a single word. If you think you can talk about quantum theory without feeling dizzy, you haven't understood the first thing about it.   \n",

Investigations of the comment include: Jan Noordegraaf (1997) \"Multatuli, Voltaire en de etymologie\" in Voorlopig verleden. Taalkundige plaatsbepalingen 1797-1960 (Münster: Nodus Publikationen) pp. 212-214 (). John Considine (January 2009) \"Les voyelles ne font rien, et les consonnes fort peu de chose\": On the history of Voltaire's supposed comment on etymology\" Historiographia Linguistica Volume 36, Issue 1, pp. 181-189; Garson O'Toole (25 March 2019) \"In Etymology Vowels Count for Nothing and Consonants for Very Little\" Quote Investigator From these, the earliest version found is already attributed to Voltaire: August Wilhelm von Schlegel (Part 1) of \"Review of 'Altdeutsche Wälder' vol. 1 by the Grimm brothers (Cassel 1813)\" (1815) Heidelberger Jahrbücher der Literatur no. 46 pp. 734-5 Mit solchen Allgemeinsätzen kann man Alles erkünsteln, und macht am Ende die Etymologie zu einer Wissenschaft, wobei, wie Voltaire sagt, die Vokale für gar nichts, die Konsonanten für wenig gerechnet werden. With such generalities one can artificialize everything, and in the end turn etymology into a science in which, as Voltaire says, the vowels are reckoned for nothing, the consonants for little. The earliest French version has singular voyelle / consonne: Anonymous (October 1833) \"Art. VII. -Grimm's Deutche Grammatik. Gottingen. 1822-1831. 3 vols\", The Quarterly Review (John Murray, London) volume 50 p. 169: It is in works of this nature that Germany is pre-eminent among the European nations; and it is long since those who are interested in philological researches have made a more valuable acquisition, or one more fit to wipe out from their favourite study the reproach which has been somewhat speciously cast on it, that it is a science 'où la voyelle ne fait rien, et la consonne fort peu de chose. ' Friedrich Max Müller ascribes the same French to Voltaire in October 1851: \"Review of Franz Bopp, Comparative Grammar of the Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Gothic, German, and Sclavonic Languages, transl. by Edward Backhouse Eastwick\" Edinburgh Review v. 94, no. CXCII p. 298 Müller gives the plural voyelles / consonnes version in 1864 \"Lecture VI: On the Principles of Etymology\" Lectures on the Science of Language; Second Series (London: Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green) p. 238 Leonard Bloomfield (1933) Language (New York: Henry Holt) cites Muller 1864. (s. 1. 3 p. 6 and Notes p. 511) Pierre Guiraud (1979) [1972] L'étymologie Que sais-je? vol. 1122 (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France) 4th ed. p. 24 says that Voltaire's quote specifically refers to the etymologies in Gilles Ménage's Les Origines de la langue françoise (1650; expanded in 1670 as Dictionnaire Etymologique). Guiraud prepends the etymology quote to an actual quote from Voltaire's Histoire de l'empire de Russie sous Pierre le Grand. .

This statement appears as a caption of narration in the last panel of the story and was not a spoken line by any character in the story. In most retellings of Spider-Man's origin, including the 2002 film, the quote has been retconned (the alteration of previously established facts in the continuity of a fictional work) to depict Uncle Ben's final lecture to Peter Parker before Ben's tragic death and as the words that continue to drive Peter as Spider-Man. Also, the correct Amazing Fantasy quote is, \"With great power there must also come great responsibility. \"   \n",

You enter by yourself. \"Boys must not have th' ambitious care of men, Nor men the weak anxieties of age. \" Horace, Of the Art of Poetry, Wentworth Dillon's trans, line 212. (19 BC) \"But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, and the best schools in the world - and none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities. Unless you show up to those schools; pay attention to those teachers; listen to your parents, grandparents and other adults; and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. And that's what I want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you has something you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide. Maybe you could be a good writer - maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper - but you might not know it until you write a paper for your English class. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor - maybe even good enough to come up with the next iPhone - but you might not know it until you do a project for your science class. Maybe you could be a mayor or a Senator or a Supreme Court Justice - but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team. \" Barack Obama, Speech at Arlington, Virginia (2009)   \n",

      "29294  Every one who is fond of reading books of travel in the tropics must know what it is like to long for an hour or two of real life in a virgin forest, or in the boundless expanses of the pampas, or even in the depths of a mangrove swamp. We would willingly put up with mosquitoes and \"piums\" and poisonous ants, if we could but see that world for ourselves which Darwin and and Wallace and have made almost, but not quite, a reality for us. Charles Kingsley had this ambition all his life, and was able in the end to indulge it. His enthusiastic delight at what he saw in the West Indies made him more than usually eloquent, and his chapter on the \"High Woods\" marks perhaps the highest point which a traveller's descriptive power can reach.   \n",

      "3194   The gratitude of every home in our Island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the World War by their prowess and by their devotion. Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. All hearts go out to the fighter pilots, whose brilliant actions we see with our own eyes day after day; but we must never forget that all the time, night after night, month after month, our bomber squadrons travel far into Germany, find their targets in the darkness by the highest navigational skill, aim their attacks, often under the heaviest fire, often with serious loss, with deliberate careful discrimination, and inflict shattering blows upon the whole of the technical and war-making structure of the Nazi power. |first=Hazel |last=Crozier |title= RAF Uxbridge 90th Anniversary 1917–2007 |publisher=RAF High Wycombe: Air Command Media Services }} Churchill repeated the quote in a speech to Parliament four days later complimenting the pilots in the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain. The speech in the House of Commons is often incorrectly cited as the origin of the popular phrase \"never was so much owed by so many to so few\". Queen Elizabeth II during her speech in Polish Parliament 26. 03. 1996 said that Churchill said \"so few\" about unforgettable and brave Polish pilots from Battle of Britain.   \n",

Electoral propaganda was at first directed primarily at industrial workers, in the hope of detaching them from the KDP. But in the 1928 elections showed unexpected gains amongst the Protestant peasantry, who had suffered badly from the agricultural crisis. From then on was more targeted at conservative voters, and this paid off with electoral breakthrough in 1930.   \n",

It's much more exciting not to know what's going to happen. I don't think that plot is important. If you see a movie of two people talking, you can watch it over and over again without being bored. You get involved – you miss things – you come back to it. . But you can't see the same movie over again if it has a plot because you already know the ending. . Everyone is rich. Everyone is interesting. Years ago, people used to sit looking out of their windows at the street. Or on a park bench. They would stay for hours without being bored although nothing much was going on. This is my favorite theme in movie making – just watching something happening for two hours or so. . I still think it's nice to care about people. And Hollywood movies are uncaring. We're pop people. We took a tour of Universal Studios in Los Angeles and, inside and outside the place, it was very difficult to tell what was real. They're not-real people trying to say something. And we're real people not trying to say anything. I just like everybody and I believe in everything. |date=August 12, 2003 |work=Da Capo Press |page=327 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 }}   \n",

And that's what I want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you has something you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide.

XIV, 49 (Latin, Peabody, Falconer) \"'\" translated to English as \"leisure of old age\" (Peabody) or \"leisured old age\" (Falconer), translated to Japanese as \" (Yoshida 1950). Alternate translation (Falconer): But how blessed it is for the soul, after having, as it were, finished its campaigns of lust and ambition, of strife and enmity and of all the passions, to return within itself, and, as the saying is, \"to live apart\"! And indeed if it has any provender, so to speak, of study and learning, nothing is more enjoyable than a leisured old age.   \n",

This statement appears as a caption of narration in the last panel of the story and was not a spoken line by any character in the story. In most retellings of Spider-Man's origin, including the 2002 film, the quote has been retconned (the alteration of previously established facts in the continuity of a fictional work) to depict Uncle Ben's final lecture to Peter Parker before Ben's tragic death and as the words that continue to drive Peter as Spider-Man. Also, the correct Amazing Fantasy quote is, \"With great power there must also come great responsibility. \"   \n",

You enter by yourself. \"Boys must not have th' ambitious care of men, Nor men the weak anxieties of age. \" Horace, Of the Art of Poetry, Wentworth Dillon's trans, line 212. (19 BC) \"But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, and the best schools in the world - and none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities. Unless you show up to those schools; pay attention to those teachers; listen to your parents, grandparents and other adults; and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. And that's what I want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you has something you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide. Maybe you could be a good writer - maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper - but you might not know it until you write a paper for your English class. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor - maybe even good enough to come up with the next iPhone - but you might not know it until you do a project for your science class. Maybe you could be a mayor or a Senator or a Supreme Court Justice - but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team. \" Barack Obama, Speech at Arlington, Virginia (2009)   \n",

You enter by yourself. \"Boys must not have th' ambitious care of men, Nor men the weak anxieties of age. \" Horace, Of the Art of Poetry, Wentworth Dillon's trans, line 212. (19 BC) \"But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, and the best schools in the world - and none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities. Unless you show up to those schools; pay attention to those teachers; listen to your parents, grandparents and other adults; and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. And that's what I want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you has something you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide. Maybe you could be a good writer - maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper - but you might not know it until you write a paper for your English class. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor - maybe even good enough to come up with the next iPhone - but you might not know it until you do a project for your science class. Maybe you could be a mayor or a Senator or a Supreme Court Justice - but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team. \" Barack Obama, Speech at Arlington, Virginia (2009)</td>\n",

To be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all. \" Book XVII, Chapter XXII \"'\" means \"to gamble\" in Modern Chinese, and \"to play Go; to play chess\" in Classical Chinese (博弈, 博奕). It is translated as \"gamesters and chess players\" (Legge 1861), \"play at chequers\" (Lyall 1909), and \"checker or chess players\" (Soothill 1910).   \n",

This statement appears as a caption of narration in the last panel of the story and was not a spoken line by any character in the story. In most retellings of Spider-Man's origin, including the 2002 film, the quote has been retconned (the alteration of previously established facts in the continuity of a fictional work) to depict Uncle Ben's final lecture to Peter Parker before Ben's tragic death and as the words that continue to drive Peter as Spider-Man. Also, the correct Amazing Fantasy quote is, \"With great power there must also come great responsibility. \"   \n",

You enter by yourself. \"Boys must not have th' ambitious care of men, Nor men the weak anxieties of age. \" Horace, Of the Art of Poetry, Wentworth Dillon's trans, line 212. (19 BC) \"But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, and the best schools in the world - and none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities. Unless you show up to those schools; pay attention to those teachers; listen to your parents, grandparents and other adults; and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. And that's what I want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you has something you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide. Maybe you could be a good writer - maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper - but you might not know it until you write a paper for your English class. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor - maybe even good enough to come up with the next iPhone - but you might not know it until you do a project for your science class. Maybe you could be a mayor or a Senator or a Supreme Court Justice - but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team. \" Barack Obama, Speech at Arlington, Virginia (2009)   \n",

On the one hand, it has not the accent of mere vituperation, it is thoroughly dignified; and on the other, it is not the language of a person who is mainly concerned with wangling somebody into believing something. When Mr. Jefferson wrote that one of his associates in Washington's cabinet was \"a fool and a blabber, \" his words, taken in their context, make exactly the same impression of calm, disinterested and objective appraisal as if he had remarked that the man had black hair and brown eyes. Or again, while we are about it, let us examine the most extreme example of this sort of thing that I have so far found in English literature, which is Kent's opinion of Oswald, in King Lear: :: Kent. Fellow, I know thee. :: Osw. What dost thou know me for? :: Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking whoreson, glass-gazing, &amp; super-servicable, finical rogue; onetrunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch. : Now, considering Kent's character and conduct, as shown throughout the play, I doubt very much that those lines should be taken as merely so much indecent blackguarding. . . an actor who ranted through them in the tone and accent of sheer violent diatribe would ruin his part. Frank Warrin cited those lines the other day, when he was telling me how much he would enjoy a revival of Lear, with our gifted friend Bill Parke cast for the part of Kent. He said, \"Can't you hear Bill's voice growing quieter and quieter, colder and colder, deadlier and deadlier, all the way through that passage? \" Angry as Kent is, and plain as his language is, his tone and manner must carry a strong suggestion of objectivity in order to keep fully up to the dramatist's conception of his role. Kent is not abusing Oswald; he is merely, as we say, \"telling him. \": * Albert Jay Nock, in \"Free Speech and Plain Language\" The Atlantic Monthly (January 1936)</td>\n",

Well aware how critical a decision confronted him, he turned to his staff, remarking: :: \"We may still draw back but, once across that little bridge, we shall have to fight it out\": As he stood, in two minds, an apparition of superhuman size and beauty was seen sitting on the river bank playing a reed pipe. A party of shepherds gathered around to listen and, when some of Caesar's men broke ranks to do the same, the apparition snatched a trumpet from one of them, ran down to the river, blew a thunderous blast, and crossed over. Caesar exclaimed: :: \"Let us accept this as a sign from the Gods, and follow where they beckon, in vengeance on our double-dealing enemies. The die is cast. \": He led his army to the farther bank, where he welcomed the tribunes of the people who had fled to him from Rome. Then he tearfully addressed the troops and, ripping open his tunic to expose his breast, begged them to stand faithfully by him. :* Suetonius, in The Twelve Caesars, as translated by Robert Graves (1957), ¶ 31-33: * Variant translations: :* He caught up with his cohorts at the River Rubicon, which was the boundary of his province, where he paused for a while, thinking over the magnitude of what he was planning, then, turning to his closest companions, he said: \"Even now we can still turn back. But once we have crossed that little bridge, everything must be decided by arms. \" As he paused, the following portent occurred. A being of splendid size and beauty suddenly appeared, sitting close by, and playing music on a reed. A large number of shepherds hurried to listen to him and even some of the soldiers left their posts to come, trumpeters among them. From one of these, the apparition seized a trumpet, leapt down to the river, and with a huge blast sounded the call to arms and crossed over to the other bank. Then said Caesar: \"Let us go where the gods have shown us the way and the injustice of our enemies calls us. The die is cast. \" And so the army crossed over and welcomed the tribunes of the plebs who had come over to them, having been expelled from Rome. Caesar addressed the sol- diers, appealing to their loyalty, with tears, and ripping the garments from his breast. :**As translated by Catherine Edwards (2000)</td>\n",

Gen. Maxwell Taylor, two hours to surrender or face \"total annihilation. \" It offered \"the privileges of the Geneva Convention\" to the would-be POWs. What came next would be one of World War II's seminal moments. As [Vincent] Vicari, McAuliffe's personal aide, recalls it 60 years later, \"General Mac read the note and said, 'Aw, nuts. ' Then he asked, 'What should I tell them? ' \" Lt. Col. Harry W. O. Kinnard, the division operations officer, said, \"Why not tell them what you just said? \" \"What did I just say? \" \"You said, 'Nuts, ' \" Kinnard replied. McAuliffe scribbled a reply: :: \"To the German commander. :: : Nuts! :: From the American commander. \": He handed the message to Lt. Col. Joseph Harper, who had escorted the couriers. To the Germans who didn't understand the Yankee colloquialism, Harper explained: \"It means the same thing as 'Go to hell. ' \" While World War II historian Barry Turner says McAuliffe's one-word riposte \"lost something in translation, \" others have speculated that \"nuts\" might be a sanitized version of what the tough paratroop general actually said. Not so, Vicari says. \"General Mac was the only general I ever knew who did not use profane language, \" he said in a telephone interview. \" 'Nuts' was part of his normal vocabulary. \": * Richard Pyle, in \"Fateful Call Summoned Allies to Battle of Bulge\" in The Los Angeles Times (12 December 2004)</td>\n",

On the one hand, it has not the accent of mere vituperation, it is thoroughly dignified; and on the other, it is not the language of a person who is mainly concerned with wangling somebody into believing something. When Mr. Jefferson wrote that one of his associates in Washington's cabinet was \"a fool and a blabber, \" his words, taken in their context, make exactly the same impression of calm, disinterested and objective appraisal as if he had remarked that the man had black hair and brown eyes. Or again, while we are about it, let us examine the most extreme example of this sort of thing that I have so far found in English literature, which is Kent's opinion of Oswald, in King Lear: :: Kent. Fellow, I know thee. :: Osw. What dost thou know me for? :: Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking whoreson, glass-gazing, & super-servicable, finical rogue; onetrunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch. : Now, considering Kent's character and conduct, as shown throughout the play, I doubt very much that those lines should be taken as merely so much indecent blackguarding. . . an actor who ranted through them in the tone and accent of sheer violent diatribe would ruin his part. Frank Warrin cited those lines the other day, when he was telling me how much he would enjoy a revival of Lear, with our gifted friend Bill Parke cast for the part of Kent. He said, \"Can't you hear Bill's voice growing quieter and quieter, colder and colder, deadlier and deadlier, all the way through that passage? \" Angry as Kent is, and plain as his language is, his tone and manner must carry a strong suggestion of objectivity in order to keep fully up to the dramatist's conception of his role. Kent is not abusing Oswald; he is merely, as we say, \"telling him. \": * Albert Jay Nock, in \"Free Speech and Plain Language\" The Atlantic Monthly (January 1936)   \n",

       "4638   Caesar overtook his advanced guard at the river Rubicon, which formed the frontier between Gaul and Italy. Well aware how critical a decision confronted him, he turned to his staff, remarking: :: \"We may still draw back but, once across that little bridge, we shall have to fight it out\": As he stood, in two minds, an apparition of superhuman size and beauty was seen sitting on the river bank playing a reed pipe. A party of shepherds gathered around to listen and, when some of Caesar's men broke ranks to do the same, the apparition snatched a trumpet from one of them, ran down to the river, blew a thunderous blast, and crossed over. Caesar exclaimed: :: \"Let us accept this as a sign from the Gods, and follow where they beckon, in vengeance on our double-dealing enemies. The die is cast. \": He led his army to the farther bank, where he welcomed the tribunes of the people who had fled to him from Rome. Then he tearfully addressed the troops and, ripping open his tunic to expose his breast, begged them to stand faithfully by him. :* Suetonius, in The Twelve Caesars, as translated by Robert Graves (1957), ¶ 31-33: * Variant translations: :* He caught up with his cohorts at the River Rubicon, which was the boundary of his province, where he paused for a while, thinking over the magnitude of what he was planning, then, turning to his closest companions, he said: \"Even now we can still turn back. But once we have crossed that little bridge, everything must be decided by arms. \" As he paused, the following portent occurred. A being of splendid size and beauty suddenly appeared, sitting close by, and playing music on a reed. A large number of shepherds hurried to listen to him and even some of the soldiers left their posts to come, trumpeters among them. From one of these, the apparition seized a trumpet, leapt down to the river, and with a huge blast sounded the call to arms and crossed over to the other bank. Then said Caesar: \"Let us go where the gods have shown us the way and the injustice of our enemies calls us. The die is cast. \" And so the army crossed over and welcomed the tribunes of the plebs who had come over to them, having been expelled from Rome. Caesar addressed the sol- diers, appealing to their loyalty, with tears, and ripping the garments from his breast. :**As translated by Catherine Edwards (2000)   \n",

Gen. Maxwell Taylor, two hours to surrender or face \"total annihilation. \" It offered \"the privileges of the Geneva Convention\" to the would-be POWs. What came next would be one of World War II's seminal moments. As [Vincent] Vicari, McAuliffe's personal aide, recalls it 60 years later, \"General Mac read the note and said, 'Aw, nuts. ' Then he asked, 'What should I tell them? ' \" Lt. Col. Harry W. O. Kinnard, the division operations officer, said, \"Why not tell them what you just said? \" \"What did I just say? \" \"You said, 'Nuts, ' \" Kinnard replied. McAuliffe scribbled a reply: :: \"To the German commander. :: : Nuts! :: From the American commander. \": He handed the message to Lt. Col. Joseph Harper, who had escorted the couriers. To the Germans who didn't understand the Yankee colloquialism, Harper explained: \"It means the same thing as 'Go to hell. ' \" While World War II historian Barry Turner says McAuliffe's one-word riposte \"lost something in translation, \" others have speculated that \"nuts\" might be a sanitized version of what the tough paratroop general actually said. Not so, Vicari says. \"General Mac was the only general I ever knew who did not use profane language, \" he said in a telephone interview. \" 'Nuts' was part of his normal vocabulary. \": * Richard Pyle, in \"Fateful Call Summoned Allies to Battle of Bulge\" in The Los Angeles Times (12 December 2004)   \n",

He could have written an attractive chapter entitled: 'Voltaire, or the anti-poet' -- the king of nincompoops, the prince of the superficial, the anti-artist, the spokesmen of janitresses, the Father Gigogne of the editors of Siècle. :In his Lord Chesterfield's Ears, Voltaire pokes fun at that immortal soul who for nine months dwelt amidst excrement and urine. Like all idlers, Voltaire hated mystery. He might at least have detected, in this choice of dwelling-place, a grudge or satire directed by Providence against love -- and thus, in the method of procreation, a sign of Original Sin. After all we can make love only with the organs of excrement. :*Charles Baudelaire, My Heart Laid Bare, 1864-66, trans. N. Cameron (1975)   \n",

That nothing in the world could stop him. That even if he were imprisoned, he would draw on the dust-covered prison walls and on the floor, with his fingers dripped in his own spit. He said he could paint then and there if he wanted to, or if he felt like it.   \n",

It was a loose confederacy. Joseph and his people occupied the Imnaha or Grande Ronde valley in Oregon, which was considered perhaps the finest land in that part of the country. . When the last treaty was entered into by some of the bands of the Nez Perce, Joseph's band was at Lapwai, Idaho, and had nothing to do with the agreement. The elder chief in dying had counseled his son, then not more than twenty-two or twenty-three years of age, never to part with their home, assuring him that he had signed no papers. These peaceful non-treaty Indians did not even know what land had been ceded until the agent read them the government order to leave. Of course they refused.

O. Howard] had a long council with Joseph and his leading men, telling them they must obey the order or be driven out by force. . Joseph was a mere youth without experience in war or public affairs. He now replied in his simple way that neither he nor his father had ever made any treaty disposing of their country, that no other band of the Nez Perces was authorized to speak for them, and it would seem a mighty injustice and unkindness. .   \n",

He had only this to say to his people: \"I have tried to save you from suffering and sorrow. Resistance means all of that. We are few. They are many. You can see all we have at a glance. They have food and ammunition in abundance. We must suffer great hardship and loss. \" After this speech, he quietly began his plans for the defense.   \n",

Vladimir Putin as head of the FSB took care of that problem for Boris Yeltsin. Putin arranged for a video to be broadcast on television that showed the prosecutor or somebody who maybe kind of looked like the prosecutor in bed with not one but two young very young females. :The video was low enough quality and it was shot from sort of oblique enough angles that you couldn`t necessarily tell with the naked eye who this grown man was with these girls in this bed. But Putin stepped up in his authority as head of the FSB. Vladimir Putin assured the Russian public that he could guarantee that the man in the video was in fact that prosecutor. :And so that was the end of that prosecutor and that was the end of the corruption investigation into Boris Yeltsin and his family. And in gratitude, or at least in payback, Boris Yeltsin decided that he would name as the next prime minister of Russia and then the next president of Russia that FSB guy who helped him out, Vladimir Putin. :* Rachel Maddow Transcript: The Rachel Maddow Show 4/18/22   \n",

Charles Kingsley had this ambition all his life, and was able in the end to indulge it. His enthusiastic delight at what he saw in the West Indies made him more than usually eloquent, and his chapter on the \"High Woods\" marks perhaps the highest point which a traveller's descriptive power can reach.   \n",

When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give to them, when the freedom they wished for most was freedom from responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and was never free again. :* This quotation appeared in an article by Margaret Thatcher, \"The Moral Foundations of Society\" (Imprimis, March 1995), which was an edited version of a lecture Thatcher had given at Hillsdale College in November 1994. Here is the actual passage from Thatcher's article: :: [M]ore than they wanted freedom, the Athenians wanted security. Yet they lost everything—security, comfort, and freedom. This was because they wanted not to give to society, but for society to give to them. The freedom they were seeking was freedom from responsibility. It is no wonder, then, that they ceased to be free. In the modern world, we should recall the Athenians' dire fate whenever we confront demands for increased state paternalism. :: The italicized passage above originated with Thatcher. In characterizing the Athenians in the article she cited Sir Edward Gibbon, but she seems to have been paraphrasing statements in \"Athens' Failure, \" a chapter of classicist Edith Hamilton's book The Echo of Greece (1957), pp. 47–48).</td>\n",

I pace the leafy colonnade Where level branches of the plane Above me weave a roof of shade Impervious to the sun and rain. At times a sudden rush of air Flutters the lazy leaves o'erhead, And gleams of sunshine toss and flare Like torches down the path I tread. By Somariva's garden gate I make the marble stairs my seat, And hear the water, as I wait, Lapping the steps beneath my feet. The undulation sinks and swells Along the stony parapets, And far away the floating bells Tinkle upon the- fisher's nets. Silent and slow, by tower and town The freighted barges come and go, Their pendent shadows gliding down By town and tower submerged below. The hills sweep upward from the shore With villas scattered one by one Upon their wooded spurs, and lower Bellagio blazing in the sun. And dimly seen, a tangled mass Of walls and woods, of light and shade, Stands beckoning up the Stelvio Pass Varenna with its white cascade. I ask myself, Is this a dream? Will it all vanish into air-? Is there a land of such supreme And perfect beauty anywhere? Sweet vision! Do not fade away; Linger until my heart shall take Into itself the summer day, And all the, beauty of the lake. Linger until upon my brain Is stamped an image of the scene, Then fade into the air again, And be as if thou hadst not been.</td>\n",

They stand four-square for the American home--but not for housing. They are strong for labor--but they are stronger for restricting labor's rights. They favor minimum wage--the smaller the minimum wage the better. They endorse educational opportunity for all--but they won't spend money for teachers or for schools. They think modern medical care and hospitals are fine--for people who can afford them. . .They think the American standard of living is a fine thing--so long as it doesn't spread to all the people. And they admire the Government of the United States so much that they would like to buy it. − Harry S.

This commonly occurreth only in solitude (such is God's will) and, none seeing the end, we say the man is lost, or gone on a long journey—which indeed he hath; but sometimes it hath happened in sight of many, as abundant testimony showeth. In one kind of death the spirit also dieth, and this it hath been known to do while yet the body was in vigor for many years. Sometimes, as is veritably attested, it dieth with the body, but after a season is raised up again in that place where the body did decay.   \n",

Protruded at long intervals above it, stood strangely shaped and somber-colored rocks, which seemed to have an understanding with one another and to exchange looks of uncomfortable significance, as if they had reared their heads to watch the issue of some foreseen event. A few blasted trees here and there appeared as leaders in this malevolent conspiracy of silent expectation.   \n",

They wanted a comfortable life, and they lost it all – security, comfort, and freedom. When the Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give to them, when the freedom they wished for most was freedom from responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and was never free again. :* This quotation appeared in an article by Margaret Thatcher, \"The Moral Foundations of Society\" (Imprimis, March 1995), which was an edited version of a lecture Thatcher had given at Hillsdale College in November 1994. Here is the actual passage from Thatcher's article: :: [M]ore than they wanted freedom, the Athenians wanted security. Yet they lost everything—security, comfort, and freedom. This was because they wanted not to give to society, but for society to give to them. The freedom they were seeking was freedom from responsibility. It is no wonder, then, that they ceased to be free. In the modern world, we should recall the Athenians' dire fate whenever we confront demands for increased state paternalism. :: The italicized passage above originated with Thatcher. In characterizing the Athenians in the article she cited Sir Edward Gibbon, but she seems to have been paraphrasing statements in \"Athens' Failure, \" a chapter of classicist Edith Hamilton's book The Echo of Greece (1957), pp. 47–48).   \n",
       "28030  No sound of wheels or hoof-beat breaks The silence of the summer day, As by the loveliest of all lakes I while the idle hours away. I pace the leafy colonnade Where level branches of the plane Above me weave a roof of shade Impervious to the sun and rain. At times a sudden rush of air Flutters the lazy leaves o'erhead, And gleams of sunshine toss and flare Like torches down the path I tread. By Somariva's garden gate I make the marble stairs my seat, And hear the water, as I wait, Lapping the steps beneath my feet. The undulation sinks and swells Along the stony parapets, And far away the floating bells Tinkle upon the- fisher's nets. Silent and slow, by tower and town The freighted barges come and go, Their pendent shadows gliding down By town and tower submerged below. The hills sweep upward from the shore With villas scattered one by one Upon their wooded spurs, and lower Bellagio blazing in the sun. And dimly seen, a tangled mass Of walls and woods, of light and shade, Stands beckoning up the Stelvio Pass Varenna with its white cascade. I ask myself, Is this a dream? Will it all vanish into air-? Is there a land of such supreme And perfect beauty anywhere? Sweet vision! Do not fade away; Linger until my heart shall take Into itself the summer day, And all the, beauty of the lake. Linger until upon my brain Is stamped an image of the scene, Then fade into the air again, And be as if thou hadst not been.   \n",

Let me add: One miracle is just as easy to believe as another. :Darrow: Just as hard? :Bryan: It is hard to believe for you, but easy for me. A miracle is a thing performed beyond what man can perform. When you get within the realm of miracles; and it is just as easy to believe the miracle of Jonah as any other miracle in the Bible. :Darrow: Perfectly easy to believe that Jonah swallowed the whale? :Bryan: If the Bible said so; the Bible doesn't make as extreme statements as evolutionists do. :Darrow: The Bible says Joshua commanded the sun to stand still for the purpose of lengthening the day, doesn't it, and you believe it. :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Do you believe at that time the entire sun went around the earth? :Bryan: No, I believe that the earth goes around the sun. :Darrow: Do you believe that the men who wrote it thought that the day could be lengthened or that the sun could be stopped? :Bryan: I don't know what they thought. :Darrow: You don't know? :Bryan: I think they wrote the fact without expressing their own thoughts. :Darrow: Have you an opinion as to whether or not the men who wrote that thought--: Thomas Stewart: (a prosecution lawyer)--I want to object, your honor. It has gone beyond the pale of any issue that could possibly be injected into this lawsuit, except by imagination. I do not think the defendant has a right to conduct the examination any further and I ask your honor to exclude it. :Bryan: It seems to me it would be too exacting to confine the defense to the facts. If they are not allowed to get away from the facts, what have they to deal with? :Judge: Mr. Bryan is willing to be examined. Go ahead. :Darrow: Can you answer my question directly? If the day was lengthened by stopping either the earth or the sun, it must have been the earth? :Bryan: Well, I should say so. :Darrow: Now, Mr. Bryan, have you ever pondered what would have happened to the earth if it had stood still? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: You have not? :Bryan: No; the God I believe in could have taken care of that, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: I see. Have you ever pondered what would naturally happen to the earth if it stood still suddenly? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Don't you know it would have been converted into molten mass of matter? :Bryan: You testify to that when you get on the stand, I will give you a chance. :Darrow: Don't you believe it? :Bryan: I would want to hear expert testimony on that. :Darrow: You have never investigated that subject? :Bryan: I don't think I have ever had the question asked. :Darrow: Or ever thought of it? :Bryan: I have been too busy on things that I thought were of more importance. :Darrow: You believe the story of the flood to be a literal interpretation? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: When was that flood? :Bryan: I would not attempt to fix the date. The date is fixed, as suggested this morning. :Darrow: About 4004 B. C. ?: Bryan: That has been the estimate of a man that is accepted today. [A witness had testified on Bishop Ussher's theory that the Earth was formed in 4004 B. C. ] I would not say it is accurate. :Darrow: That estimate is printed in the Bible? :Bryan: Everybody knows, at least, I think most of the people know, that was the estimate given. :Darrow: But what do you think that the Bible itself says? Don't you know how it was arrived at? :Bryan: I never made a calculation. :Darrow: A calculation from what? :Bryan: I could not say. :Darrow: From the generations of man? :Bryan: I would not want to say that. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think about things I don't think about. :Darrow: Do you think about things you do think about? :Bryan: Well, sometimes. (Laughter. ): Policeman Deputy Clason: Let us have order. . .: Thomas Stewart: {prosecution attorney}--Your honor, he is perfectly able to take care of this, but we are attaining no evidence. This is not competent evidence. :Bryan: These gentlemen have not had much chance--they did not come here to try this case. They came here to try revealed religion. I am here to defend it and they can ask me any question they please. :Judge: All right. (Applause. ): Darrow: Great applause from the bleachers. :Bryan: Darrow--I have never called them yokels. :Bryan: That is the ignorance of Tennessee, the bigotry. :Darrow: You mean who are applauding you? (Applause. ): Bryan: Those are the people whom you insult. :Darrow: You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does believe in your fool religion. :Judge: I will not stand for that. :Darrow: For what he is doing? :Judge: I am talking to both of you. :Darrow: Do you know anything about how many people there were in Egypt 3, 500 years ago, or how many people there were in China 5, 000 years ago? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Have you ever tried to find out? :Bryan: No, sir. You are the first man I ever heard of who has been interested in it. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, am I the first man you ever heard of who has been interested in the age of human societies and primitive man? :Bryan: You are the first man I ever heard speak of the number of people at those different periods. :Darrow: Where have you lived all your life? :Bryan: Not near you. (Laughter and applause. ): Darrow: Nor near anybody of learning? :Bryan: Oh, don't assume you know it all. :Darrow: Do you know there are thousands of books in our libraries on all those subjects I have been asking you about? :Bryan: I couldn't say, but I will take your word for it. . .: Darrow: Have you any idea how old the earth is? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The book you have introduced in evidence tells you, doesn't it? :Bryan: I don't think it does, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: Let's see whether it does; is this the one? :Bryan: That is the one, I think. :Darrow: It says B. C. 4004? :Bryan: That is Bishop Ussher's calculation. :Darrow: That is printed in the Bible you introduced? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: Would you say that the earth was only 4, 000 years old? :Bryan: Oh, no; I think it is much older than that. :Darrow: How much? :Bryan: I couldn't say. :Darrow: Do you say whether the Bible itself says it is older than that? :Bryan: I don't think it is older or not. :Darrow: Do you think the earth was made in six days? :Bryan: Not six days of 24 hours. :Darrow: Doesn't it say so? :Bryan: No, sir. :Judge: Are you about through, Mr. Darrow? :Darrow: I want to ask a few more questions about the creation. :Judge: I know. We are going to adjourn when Mr. Bryan comes off the stand for the day. Be very brief, Mr. Darrow. Of course, I believe I will make myself clearer. Of course, it is incompetent testimony before the jury. The only reason I am allowing this to go in at all is that they may have it in the appellate court as showing what the affidavit would be. :Bryan: The reason I am answering is not for the benefit of the superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him. :Darrow: I want to take an exception to this conduct of this witness. He may be very popular down here in the hills--: Bryan: Your honor, they have not asked a question legally and the only reason they have asked any question is for the purpose, as the question about Jonah was asked, for a chance to give this agnostic an opportunity to criticize a believer in the world of God; and I answered the question in order to shut his mouth so that he cannot go out and tell his atheistic friends that I would not answer his questions. That is the only reason, no more reason in the world. :Malone: (another defense counsel) Your honor on this very subject, I would like to say that I would have asked Mr. Bryan, and I consider myself as good a Christian as he is, every question that Mr. Darrow has asked him for the purpose of bringing out whether or not there is to be taken in this court a literal interpretation of the Bible, or whether, obviously, as these questions indicate, if a general and literal construction cannot be put upon the parts of the Bible which have been covered by Mr. Darrow's questions. I hope for the last time no further attempt will be made by counsel on the other side of the case, or Mr. Bryan, to say the defense is concerned at all with Mr. Darrow's particular religious views or lack of religious views. We are here as lawyers with the same right to our views. I have the same right to mine as a Christian as Mr. Bryan has to his, and we do not intend to have this case charged by Mr. Darrow's agnosticism or Mr. Bryan's brand of Christianity. (A great applause. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, do you believe that the first woman was Eve? :Bryan: Yes. :Darrow: Do you believe she was literally made out of Adam's rib? :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Did you ever discover where Cain got his wife? :Bryan: No, sir. I leave the agnostics to hunt for her. :Darrow: You have never found out? :Bryan: I have never tried to find out. :Darrow: You have never tried to find out? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The Bible says he got one, doesn't it? Were there other people on the earth at that time? :Bryan: I cannot say. :Darrow: You cannot say. Did that ever enter your consideration? :Bryan: Never bothered me. :Darrow: There were no others recorded, but Cain got a wife. :Bryan: That is what the Bible says. :Darrow: Where she came from you do not know. All right. Does the statement, \"The morning and the evening were the first day, \" and \"The morning and the evening were the second day, \" mean anything to you? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily means a 24-hour day. :Darrow: You do not? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: What do you consider it to be? :Bryan: I have not attempted to explain it. If you will take the second chapter--let me have the book. [Reaches for a Bible. ] The fourth verse of the second chapter says: \"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth, when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, \" the word day there in the very next chapter is used to describe a period. I do not see that there is any necessity for construing the words, \"the evening and the morning, \" as meaning necessarily a 24-hour day, \"in the day when the Lord made the heaven and the earth. \": Darrow: Then, when the Bible said, for instance, \"and God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day, \" that does not necessarily mean twenty-four hours? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily does. :Darrow: Do you think it does or does not? :Bryan: I know a great many think so. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think it does. :Darrow: You think those were not literal days? :Bryan: I do not think they were twenty-four-hour days. :Darrow: What do you think about it? :Bryan: That is my opinion--I do not know that my opinion is better on that subject than those who think it does. :Darrow: You do not think that? :Bryan: No. But I think it would be just as easy for the kind of God we believe in to make the earth in six days as in six years or in 6 million years or in 600 million years. I do not think it important whether we believe one or the other. :Darrow: Do you think those were literal days? :Bryan: My impression is they were periods, but I would not attempt to argue against anybody who wanted to believe in literal days. :Darrow: I will read it to you from the Bible: \"And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. \" Do you think that is why the serpent is compelled to crawl upon its belly? :Bryan: I believe that. :Darrow: Have you any idea how the snake went before that time? :Bryan: No, sir. :Darrow: Do you know whether he walked on his tail or not? :Bryan: No, sir. I have no way to know. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Now, you refer to the cloud that was put in heaven after the flood, the rainbow. Do you believe in that? :Bryan: Read it. :Darrow: All right, Mr. Bryan, I will read it for you. :Bryan: Your Honor, I think I can shorten this testimony. The only purpose Mr. Darrow has is to slur at the Bible, but I will answer his question. I will answer it all at once, and I have no objection in the world. I want the world to know that this man, who does not believe in a God, is trying to use a court in Tennessee to slur at it, and while it will require time, I am willing to take it. :Darrow: I object to your statement. I am examining you on your fool ideas that no intelligent Christian on earth believes. :Judge: Court is adjourned until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. :* Clarence Darrow's examination of William Jennings Bryan at the 1925 Scopes trial Scopes Trial Day 7</td>\n",
       "      <td>Judge: Do you want Mr. Bryan sworn? :Darrow: No. :Bryan: I can make affirmation; I can say \"So help me God, I will tell the truth. \": Darrow: No, I take it you will tell the truth, Mr. Bryan. You have given considerable study to the Bible, haven't you, Mr. Bryan? :Bryan: Yes, sir, I have tried to. :Darrow: Then you have made a general study of it? :Bryan: Yes, I have; I have studied the Bible for about 50 years, or sometime more than that, but, of course, I have studied it more as I have become older than when I was but a boy. :Darrow: You claim that everything in the Bible should be literally interpreted? :Bryan: I believe everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there: some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: \"Ye are the salt of the earth. \" I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving God's people. :Darrow: But when you read that Jonah swallowed the whale--or that the whale swallowed Jonah--excuse me please--how do you literally interpret that? :Bryan: When I read that a \"big fish\" swallowed Jonah--it does not say whale. That is my recollection of it. A big fish, and I believe it, and I believe in a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both what He pleases. :Darrow: Now, you say, the big fish swallowed Jonah, and he there remained how long--three days--and then he spewed him upon the land.

Through all the years that I have been in business I have never yet found our business bad as a result of any outside force. It has always been due to some defect in our own company, and whenever we located and repaired that defect our business became good again - regardless of what anyone else might be doing. And it will always be found that this country has nationally bad business when business men are drifting, and that business is good when men take hold of their own affairs, put leadership into them, and push forward in spite of obstacles. Only disaster can result when the fundamental principles of business are disregarded and what looks like the easiest way is taken. These fundamentals, as I see them, are: :(1) To make an ever increasingly large quantity of goods of the best possible quality, to make them in the best and most economical fashion, and to force them out onto the market. :(2) To strive always for higher quality and lower prices as well as lower costs. :(3) To raise wages gradually but continuously B and never to cut them. :(4) To get the goods to the consumer in the most economical manner so that the benefits of low cost production may reach him. :These fundamentals are all summed up in the single word 'service'. . The service starts with discovering what people need and then supplying that need according to the principles that have just been given. :* Henry Ford in: Justus George Frederick (1930), A Philosophy of Production: A Symposium, p. 32; as cited in: Morgen Witzel (2003) Fifty Key Figures in Management. p. 196   \n",

best things I read was an 1889 essay by Andrew Carnegie called The Gospel of Wealth. It makes the case that the wealthy have a responsibility to return their resources to society, a radical idea at the time that laid the groundwork for philanthropy as we know it today. :In the essay's most famous line, Carnegie argues that \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced. \" I have spent a lot of time thinking about that quote lately. People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that \"he died rich\" will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people. :That is why I have decided to give my money back to society much faster than I had originally planned. I will give away virtually all my wealth through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years to the cause of saving and improving lives around the world. :*As quoted in Gates Notes (May 8, 2025)   \n",

thing or another, and by good luck was found by some peasants who had lost an ass, and they carried me to the nearest habitation, which was one of those large, low, thatch-roofed farm-houses, with apartments in the garret for the family, and a cunning little porch under the deep gable decorated with boxes of bright colored flowers and cats; on the ground floor a large and light sitting-room, separated from the milch-cattle apartment by a partition; and in the front yard rose stately and fine the wealth and pride of the house, the manure-pile. That sentence is Germanic, and shows that I am acquiring that sort of mastery of the art and spirit of the language which enables a man to travel all day in one sentence without changing cars. :*Book I, Ch. 1   \n",

powerful influence over the body. From the beginning of time, the sorcerer, the interpreter of dreams, the fortune-teller, the charlatan, the quack, the wild medicine-man, the educated physician, the mesmerist, and the hypnotist have made use of the client's imagination to help them in their work. They have all recognized the potency and availability of that force. Physicians cure many patients with a bread pill; they know that where the disease is only a fancy, the patient's confidence in the doctor will make the bread pill effective. :*Book I, Ch. 4   \n",

farmer's wife who lived five miles from our village had great fame as a faith-doctor—that was what she called herself. Sufferers came to her from all around, and she laid her hand upon them and said, \"Have faith—it is all that is necessary, \" and they went away well of their ailments. She was not a religious woman, and pretended to no occult powers. She said that the patient's faith in her did the work. Several times I saw her make immediate cures of severe toothaches. My mother was the patient. In Austria there is a peasant who drives a great trade in this sort of industry, and has both the high and the low for patients. He gets into prison every now and then for practising without a diploma, but his business is as brisk as ever when he gets out, for his work is unquestionably successful and keeps his reputation high. In Bavaria there is a man who performed so many great cures that he had to retire from his profession of stage-carpentering in order to meet the demand of his constantly increasing body of customers. He goes on from year to year doing his miracles, and has become very rich. He pretends to no religious helps, no supernatural aids, but thinks there is something in his make-up which inspires the confidence of his patients, and that it is this confidence which does the work, and not some mysterious power issuing from himself. :*Ch. 4   \n",

                 Within the last quarter of a century, in America, several sects of curers have appeared under various names and have done notable things in the way of healing ailments without the use of medicines. There are the Mind Cure, the Faith Cure, the Prayer Cure, the Mental Science Cure, and the Christian-Science Cure; and apparently they all do their miracles with the same old, powerful instrument—the patient's imagination. Differing names, but no difference in the process. But they do not give that instrument the credit; each sect claims that its way differs from the ways of the others. :They all achieve some cures, there is no question about it; and the Faith Cure and the Prayer Cure probably do no harm when they do no good, since they do not forbid the patient to help out the cure with medicines if he wants to; but the others bar medicines, and claim ability to cure every conceivable human ailment through the application of their mental forces alone. There would seem to be an element of danger here. It has the look of claiming too much, I think. Public confidence would probably be increased if less were claimed. :*Book I, Ch. 4   \n",

that beyond any question every Mohammedan is insane; not in all things, but in religious matters. When a thoughtful and unblessed Mohammedan examines the Westminster Catechism, he knows that beyond any question I am spiritually insane. I cannot prove to him that he is insane, because you never can prove anything to a lunatic — for that is a part of his insanity and the evidence of it. He cannot prove to me that I am insane, for my mind has the same defect that afflicts his. All Democrats are insane, but not one of them knows it; none but the Republicans and Mugwumps know it. All the Republicans are insane, but only the Democrats and Mugwumps can perceive it. The rule is perfect: in all matters of opinion our adversaries are insane. :*Book I, Ch. 5   \n",

The first man had it, the last one will possess it. If left to himself, a man is most likely to use only the mischievous half of the force—the half which invents imaginary ailments for him and cultivates them; and if he is one of these—very wise people, he is quite likely to scoff at the beneficent half of the force and deny its existence. And so, to heal or help that man, two imaginations are required: his own and some outsider's. The outsider, B, must imagine that his incantations are the healing-power that is curing A, and A must imagine that this is so. I think it is not so, at all; but no matter, the cure is effected, and that is the main thing. The outsider's work is unquestionably valuable; so valuable that it may fairly be likened to the essential work performed by the engineer when he handles the throttle and turns on the steam; the actual power is lodged exclusively in the engine, but if the engine were left alone it would never start of itself. Whether the engineer be named Jim, or Bob, or Tom, it is all one—his services are necessary, and he is entitled to such wage as he can get you to pay. Whether he be named Christian Scientist, or Mental Scientist, or Mind Curist, or King's-Evil Expert, or Hypnotist, it is all one; he is merely the Engineer; he simply turns on the same old steam and the engine does the whole work. :* Book I, Ch. 8   \n",

my ardour. :: Then I will wander godlike and victorious: Through the ruins of the world. :And, giving my words an active force, :I will feel equal to the Creator. :*1837, as quoted in Karl Marx: His Life and Thought by David McLellan, p. 22.

                               Everything great glitters, glitter begets ambition, and ambition can easily have caused the inspiration or what we thought to be inspiration. But reason can no longer restrain one who is lured by the fury of ambition. He tumbles where his vehement drive calls him; no longer does he choose his position, but rather chance and luster determine it. : Then we are not called to the position where we can most shine. It is not the one which, in the long succession of years during which we may hold it, will never make us weary, subdue our zeal, or dampen our inspiration. Soon we shall see our wishes unfulfilled and our ideas unsatisfied. :* Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy and Society, L. Easton, trans. (1967), p. 36   \n",
       "15  Judge: Do you want Mr. Bryan sworn? :Darrow: No. :Bryan: I can make affirmation; I can say \"So help me God, I will tell the truth. \": Darrow: No, I take it you will tell the truth, Mr. Bryan. You have given considerable study to the Bible, haven't you, Mr. Bryan? :Bryan: Yes, sir, I have tried to. :Darrow: Then you have made a general study of it? :Bryan: Yes, I have; I have studied the Bible for about 50 years, or sometime more than that, but, of course, I have studied it more as I have become older than when I was but a boy. :Darrow: You claim that everything in the Bible should be literally interpreted? :Bryan: I believe everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there: some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: \"Ye are the salt of the earth. \" I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving God's people. :Darrow: But when you read that Jonah swallowed the whale--or that the whale swallowed Jonah--excuse me please--how do you literally interpret that? :Bryan: When I read that a \"big fish\" swallowed Jonah--it does not say whale. That is my recollection of it. A big fish, and I believe it, and I believe in a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both what He pleases. :Darrow: Now, you say, the big fish swallowed Jonah, and he there remained how long--three days--and then he spewed him upon the land. You believe that the big fish was made to swallow Jonah? :Bryan: I am not prepared to say that; the Bible merely says it was done. :Darrow: You don't know whether it was the ordinary run of fish, or made for that purpose? :Bryan: You may guess; you evolutionists guess. . :Darrow: You are not prepared to say whether that fish was made especially to swallow a man or not? :Bryan: The Bible doesn't say, so I am not prepared to say. :Darrow: But do you believe He made them--that He made such a fish and that it was big enough to swallow Jonah? :Bryan: Yes, sir. Let me add: One miracle is just as easy to believe as another. :Darrow: Just as hard? :Bryan: It is hard to believe for you, but easy for me. A miracle is a thing performed beyond what man can perform. When you get within the realm of miracles; and it is just as easy to believe the miracle of Jonah as any other miracle in the Bible. :Darrow: Perfectly easy to believe that Jonah swallowed the whale? :Bryan: If the Bible said so; the Bible doesn't make as extreme statements as evolutionists do. :Darrow: The Bible says Joshua commanded the sun to stand still for the purpose of lengthening the day, doesn't it, and you believe it. :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Do you believe at that time the entire sun went around the earth? :Bryan: No, I believe that the earth goes around the sun. :Darrow: Do you believe that the men who wrote it thought that the day could be lengthened or that the sun could be stopped? :Bryan: I don't know what they thought. :Darrow: You don't know? :Bryan: I think they wrote the fact without expressing their own thoughts. :Darrow: Have you an opinion as to whether or not the men who wrote that thought--: Thomas Stewart: (a prosecution lawyer)--I want to object, your honor. It has gone beyond the pale of any issue that could possibly be injected into this lawsuit, except by imagination. I do not think the defendant has a right to conduct the examination any further and I ask your honor to exclude it. :Bryan: It seems to me it would be too exacting to confine the defense to the facts. If they are not allowed to get away from the facts, what have they to deal with? :Judge: Mr. Bryan is willing to be examined. Go ahead. :Darrow: Can you answer my question directly? If the day was lengthened by stopping either the earth or the sun, it must have been the earth? :Bryan: Well, I should say so. :Darrow: Now, Mr. Bryan, have you ever pondered what would have happened to the earth if it had stood still? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: You have not? :Bryan: No; the God I believe in could have taken care of that, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: I see. Have you ever pondered what would naturally happen to the earth if it stood still suddenly? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Don't you know it would have been converted into molten mass of matter? :Bryan: You testify to that when you get on the stand, I will give you a chance. :Darrow: Don't you believe it? :Bryan: I would want to hear expert testimony on that. :Darrow: You have never investigated that subject? :Bryan: I don't think I have ever had the question asked. :Darrow: Or ever thought of it? :Bryan: I have been too busy on things that I thought were of more importance. :Darrow: You believe the story of the flood to be a literal interpretation? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: When was that flood? :Bryan: I would not attempt to fix the date. The date is fixed, as suggested this morning. :Darrow: About 4004 B. C. ?: Bryan: That has been the estimate of a man that is accepted today. [A witness had testified on Bishop Ussher's theory that the Earth was formed in 4004 B. C. ] I would not say it is accurate. :Darrow: That estimate is printed in the Bible? :Bryan: Everybody knows, at least, I think most of the people know, that was the estimate given. :Darrow: But what do you think that the Bible itself says? Don't you know how it was arrived at? :Bryan: I never made a calculation. :Darrow: A calculation from what? :Bryan: I could not say. :Darrow: From the generations of man? :Bryan: I would not want to say that. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think about things I don't think about. :Darrow: Do you think about things you do think about? :Bryan: Well, sometimes. (Laughter. ): Policeman Deputy Clason: Let us have order. . .: Thomas Stewart: {prosecution attorney}--Your honor, he is perfectly able to take care of this, but we are attaining no evidence. This is not competent evidence. :Bryan: These gentlemen have not had much chance--they did not come here to try this case. They came here to try revealed religion. I am here to defend it and they can ask me any question they please. :Judge: All right. (Applause. ): Darrow: Great applause from the bleachers. :Bryan: Darrow--I have never called them yokels. :Bryan: That is the ignorance of Tennessee, the bigotry. :Darrow: You mean who are applauding you? (Applause. ): Bryan: Those are the people whom you insult. :Darrow: You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does believe in your fool religion. :Judge: I will not stand for that. :Darrow: For what he is doing? :Judge: I am talking to both of you. :Darrow: Do you know anything about how many people there were in Egypt 3, 500 years ago, or how many people there were in China 5, 000 years ago? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Have you ever tried to find out? :Bryan: No, sir. You are the first man I ever heard of who has been interested in it. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, am I the first man you ever heard of who has been interested in the age of human societies and primitive man? :Bryan: You are the first man I ever heard speak of the number of people at those different periods. :Darrow: Where have you lived all your life? :Bryan: Not near you. (Laughter and applause. ): Darrow: Nor near anybody of learning? :Bryan: Oh, don't assume you know it all. :Darrow: Do you know there are thousands of books in our libraries on all those subjects I have been asking you about? :Bryan: I couldn't say, but I will take your word for it. . .: Darrow: Have you any idea how old the earth is? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The book you have introduced in evidence tells you, doesn't it? :Bryan: I don't think it does, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: Let's see whether it does; is this the one? :Bryan: That is the one, I think. :Darrow: It says B. C. 4004? :Bryan: That is Bishop Ussher's calculation. :Darrow: That is printed in the Bible you introduced? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: Would you say that the earth was only 4, 000 years old? :Bryan: Oh, no; I think it is much older than that. :Darrow: How much? :Bryan: I couldn't say. :Darrow: Do you say whether the Bible itself says it is older than that? :Bryan: I don't think it is older or not. :Darrow: Do you think the earth was made in six days? :Bryan: Not six days of 24 hours. :Darrow: Doesn't it say so? :Bryan: No, sir. :Judge: Are you about through, Mr. Darrow? :Darrow: I want to ask a few more questions about the creation. :Judge: I know. We are going to adjourn when Mr. Bryan comes off the stand for the day. Be very brief, Mr. Darrow. Of course, I believe I will make myself clearer. Of course, it is incompetent testimony before the jury. The only reason I am allowing this to go in at all is that they may have it in the appellate court as showing what the affidavit would be. :Bryan: The reason I am answering is not for the benefit of the superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him. :Darrow: I want to take an exception to this conduct of this witness. He may be very popular down here in the hills--: Bryan: Your honor, they have not asked a question legally and the only reason they have asked any question is for the purpose, as the question about Jonah was asked, for a chance to give this agnostic an opportunity to criticize a believer in the world of God; and I answered the question in order to shut his mouth so that he cannot go out and tell his atheistic friends that I would not answer his questions. That is the only reason, no more reason in the world. :Malone: (another defense counsel) Your honor on this very subject, I would like to say that I would have asked Mr. Bryan, and I consider myself as good a Christian as he is, every question that Mr. Darrow has asked him for the purpose of bringing out whether or not there is to be taken in this court a literal interpretation of the Bible, or whether, obviously, as these questions indicate, if a general and literal construction cannot be put upon the parts of the Bible which have been covered by Mr. Darrow's questions. I hope for the last time no further attempt will be made by counsel on the other side of the case, or Mr. Bryan, to say the defense is concerned at all with Mr. Darrow's particular religious views or lack of religious views. We are here as lawyers with the same right to our views. I have the same right to mine as a Christian as Mr. Bryan has to his, and we do not intend to have this case charged by Mr. Darrow's agnosticism or Mr. Bryan's brand of Christianity. (A great applause. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, do you believe that the first woman was Eve? :Bryan: Yes. :Darrow: Do you believe she was literally made out of Adam's rib? :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Did you ever discover where Cain got his wife? :Bryan: No, sir. I leave the agnostics to hunt for her. :Darrow: You have never found out? :Bryan: I have never tried to find out. :Darrow: You have never tried to find out? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The Bible says he got one, doesn't it? Were there other people on the earth at that time? :Bryan: I cannot say. :Darrow: You cannot say. Did that ever enter your consideration? :Bryan: Never bothered me. :Darrow: There were no others recorded, but Cain got a wife. :Bryan: That is what the Bible says. :Darrow: Where she came from you do not know. All right. Does the statement, \"The morning and the evening were the first day, \" and \"The morning and the evening were the second day, \" mean anything to you? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily means a 24-hour day. :Darrow: You do not? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: What do you consider it to be? :Bryan: I have not attempted to explain it. If you will take the second chapter--let me have the book. [Reaches for a Bible. ] The fourth verse of the second chapter says: \"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth, when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, \" the word day there in the very next chapter is used to describe a period. I do not see that there is any necessity for construing the words, \"the evening and the morning, \" as meaning necessarily a 24-hour day, \"in the day when the Lord made the heaven and the earth. \": Darrow: Then, when the Bible said, for instance, \"and God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day, \" that does not necessarily mean twenty-four hours? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily does. :Darrow: Do you think it does or does not? :Bryan: I know a great many think so. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think it does. :Darrow: You think those were not literal days? :Bryan: I do not think they were twenty-four-hour days. :Darrow: What do you think about it? :Bryan: That is my opinion--I do not know that my opinion is better on that subject than those who think it does. :Darrow: You do not think that? :Bryan: No. But I think it would be just as easy for the kind of God we believe in to make the earth in six days as in six years or in 6 million years or in 600 million years. I do not think it important whether we believe one or the other. :Darrow: Do you think those were literal days? :Bryan: My impression is they were periods, but I would not attempt to argue against anybody who wanted to believe in literal days. :Darrow: I will read it to you from the Bible: \"And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. \" Do you think that is why the serpent is compelled to crawl upon its belly? :Bryan: I believe that. :Darrow: Have you any idea how the snake went before that time? :Bryan: No, sir. :Darrow: Do you know whether he walked on his tail or not? :Bryan: No, sir. I have no way to know. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Now, you refer to the cloud that was put in heaven after the flood, the rainbow. Do you believe in that? :Bryan: Read it. :Darrow: All right, Mr. Bryan, I will read it for you. :Bryan: Your Honor, I think I can shorten this testimony. The only purpose Mr. Darrow has is to slur at the Bible, but I will answer his question. I will answer it all at once, and I have no objection in the world. I want the world to know that this man, who does not believe in a God, is trying to use a court in Tennessee to slur at it, and while it will require time, I am willing to take it. :Darrow: I object to your statement. I am examining you on your fool ideas that no intelligent Christian on earth believes. :Judge: Court is adjourned until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. :* Clarence Darrow's examination of William Jennings Bryan at the 1925 Scopes trial Scopes Trial Day 7   \n",

first make mad with power. :# The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly small. :# The bee fertilizes the flower it robs. :# When it is dark enough, you can see the stars. :: * After being asked if he could summarize the lessons of history in a short book, Beard replied that he could do it in those four sentences; as quoted in \"Condensed History Lesson\" by Arthur H. Secord, in Reader's Digest, Vol. 38, No. 226 (February 1941), p. 20; the first statement is an adaption of an ancient anonymous proverb, sometimes wrongly attributed to Euripides. The second is from Friedrich von Logau, \"Retribution\", Sinngedichte III, 2, 24, c. 1654, as translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow(? ). The origins of the third and fourth have not been determined.   \n",

                                              The composer (organizer of sound) will be faced not only with the entire field of sound but also with the entire field of time. The 'frame' or fraction of a second, following established film technique, will probably be the basic unit in the measurement of time. No rhythm will be beyond the composer's reach. : NEW METHODS WILL BE DISCOVERED, BEARING A DEFINITE RELATION TO SCHOENBERG'S TWELVE-TONE SYSTEM   \n",

It has always been due to some defect in our own company, and whenever we located and repaired that defect our business became good again - regardless of what anyone else might be doing. And it will always be found that this country has nationally bad business when business men are drifting, and that business is good when men take hold of their own affairs, put leadership into them, and push forward in spite of obstacles. Only disaster can result when the fundamental principles of business are disregarded and what looks like the easiest way is taken. These fundamentals, as I see them, are: :(1) To make an ever increasingly large quantity of goods of the best possible quality, to make them in the best and most economical fashion, and to force them out onto the market. :(2) To strive always for higher quality and lower prices as well as lower costs. :(3) To raise wages gradually but continuously B and never to cut them. :(4) To get the goods to the consumer in the most economical manner so that the benefits of low cost production may reach him. :These fundamentals are all summed up in the single word 'service'. . The service starts with discovering what people need and then supplying that need according to the principles that have just been given.   \n",

called The Gospel of Wealth. It makes the case that the wealthy have a responsibility to return their resources to society, a radical idea at the time that laid the groundwork for philanthropy as we know it today. :In the essay's most famous line, Carnegie argues that \"the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced. \" I have spent a lot of time thinking about that quote lately. People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that \"he died rich\" will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people. :That is why I have decided to give my money back to society much faster than I had originally planned. I will give away virtually all my wealth through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years to the cause of saving and improving lives around the world.   \n",

from the Appetite-Cure in the mountains, I fell over a cliff in the twilight, and broke some arms and legs and one thing or another, and by good luck was found by some peasants who had lost an ass, and they carried me to the nearest habitation, which was one of those large, low, thatch-roofed farm-houses, with apartments in the garret for the family, and a cunning little porch under the deep gable decorated with boxes of bright colored flowers and cats; on the ground floor a large and light sitting-room, separated from the milch-cattle apartment by a partition; and in the front yard rose stately and fine the wealth and pride of the house, the manure-pile. That sentence is Germanic, and shows that I am acquiring that sort of mastery of the art and spirit of the language which enables a man to travel all day in one sentence without changing cars.   \n",

                                                        No one doubts—certainly not I—that the mind exercises a powerful influence over the body. From the beginning of time, the sorcerer, the interpreter of dreams, the fortune-teller, the charlatan, the quack, the wild medicine-man, the educated physician, the mesmerist, and the hypnotist have made use of the client's imagination to help them in their work. They have all recognized the potency and availability of that force. Physicians cure many patients with a bread pill; they know that where the disease is only a fancy, the patient's confidence in the doctor will make the bread pill effective.   \n",

she called herself. Sufferers came to her from all around, and she laid her hand upon them and said, \"Have faith—it is all that is necessary, \" and they went away well of their ailments. She was not a religious woman, and pretended to no occult powers. She said that the patient's faith in her did the work. Several times I saw her make immediate cures of severe toothaches. My mother was the patient. In Austria there is a peasant who drives a great trade in this sort of industry, and has both the high and the low for patients. He gets into prison every now and then for practising without a diploma, but his business is as brisk as ever when he gets out, for his work is unquestionably successful and keeps his reputation high. In Bavaria there is a man who performed so many great cures that he had to retire from his profession of stage-carpentering in order to meet the demand of his constantly increasing body of customers. He goes on from year to year doing his miracles, and has become very rich. He pretends to no religious helps, no supernatural aids, but thinks there is something in his make-up which inspires the confidence of his patients, and that it is this confidence which does the work, and not some mysterious power issuing from himself.   \n",

curers have appeared under various names and have done notable things in the way of healing ailments without the use of medicines. There are the Mind Cure, the Faith Cure, the Prayer Cure, the Mental Science Cure, and the Christian-Science Cure; and apparently they all do their miracles with the same old, powerful instrument—the patient's imagination. Differing names, but no difference in the process. But they do not give that instrument the credit; each sect claims that its way differs from the ways of the others. :They all achieve some cures, there is no question about it; and the Faith Cure and the Prayer Cure probably do no harm when they do no good, since they do not forbid the patient to help out the cure with medicines if he wants to; but the others bar medicines, and claim ability to cure every conceivable human ailment through the application of their mental forces alone. There would seem to be an element of danger here. It has the look of claiming too much, I think. Public confidence would probably be increased if less were claimed.   \n",

                                      When I, a thoughtful and unblessed Presbyterian, examine the Koran, I know that beyond any question every Mohammedan is insane; not in all things, but in religious matters. When a thoughtful and unblessed Mohammedan examines the Westminster Catechism, he knows that beyond any question I am spiritually insane. I cannot prove to him that he is insane, because you never can prove anything to a lunatic — for that is a part of his insanity and the evidence of it. He cannot prove to me that I am insane, for my mind has the same defect that afflicts his. All Democrats are insane, but not one of them knows it; none but the Republicans and Mugwumps know it. All the Republicans are insane, but only the Democrats and Mugwumps can perceive it. The rule is perfect: in all matters of opinion our adversaries are insane.   \n",

man's imagination has over his body to heal it or make it sick is a force which none of us is born without. The first man had it, the last one will possess it. If left to himself, a man is most likely to use only the mischievous half of the force—the half which invents imaginary ailments for him and cultivates them; and if he is one of these—very wise people, he is quite likely to scoff at the beneficent half of the force and deny its existence. And so, to heal or help that man, two imaginations are required: his own and some outsider's. The outsider, B, must imagine that his incantations are the healing-power that is curing A, and A must imagine that this is so. I think it is not so, at all; but no matter, the cure is effected, and that is the main thing. The outsider's work is unquestionably valuable; so valuable that it may fairly be likened to the essential work performed by the engineer when he handles the throttle and turns on the steam; the actual power is lodged exclusively in the engine, but if the engine were left alone it would never start of itself. Whether the engineer be named Jim, or Bob, or Tom, it is all one—his services are necessary, and he is entitled to such wage as he can get you to pay. Whether he be named Christian Scientist, or Mental Scientist, or Mind Curist, or King's-Evil Expert, or Hypnotist, it is all one; he is merely the Engineer; he simply turns on the same old steam and the engine does the whole work.   \n",



                 Everything great glitters, glitter begets ambition, and ambition can easily have caused the inspiration or what we thought to be inspiration. But reason can no longer restrain one who is lured by the fury of ambition. He tumbles where his vehement drive calls him; no longer does he choose his position, but rather chance and luster determine it. : Then we are not called to the position where we can most shine. It is not the one which, in the long succession of years during which we may hold it, will never make us weary, subdue our zeal, or dampen our inspiration. Soon we shall see our wishes unfulfilled and our ideas unsatisfied.   \n",
       "15  Judge: Do you want Mr. Bryan sworn? :Darrow: No. :Bryan: I can make affirmation; I can say \"So help me God, I will tell the truth. \": Darrow: No, I take it you will tell the truth, Mr. Bryan. You have given considerable study to the Bible, haven't you, Mr. Bryan? :Bryan: Yes, sir, I have tried to. :Darrow: Then you have made a general study of it? :Bryan: Yes, I have; I have studied the Bible for about 50 years, or sometime more than that, but, of course, I have studied it more as I have become older than when I was but a boy. :Darrow: You claim that everything in the Bible should be literally interpreted? :Bryan: I believe everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there: some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: \"Ye are the salt of the earth. \" I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving God's people. :Darrow: But when you read that Jonah swallowed the whale--or that the whale swallowed Jonah--excuse me please--how do you literally interpret that? :Bryan: When I read that a \"big fish\" swallowed Jonah--it does not say whale. That is my recollection of it. A big fish, and I believe it, and I believe in a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both what He pleases. :Darrow: Now, you say, the big fish swallowed Jonah, and he there remained how long--three days--and then he spewed him upon the land. You believe that the big fish was made to swallow Jonah? :Bryan: I am not prepared to say that; the Bible merely says it was done. :Darrow: You don't know whether it was the ordinary run of fish, or made for that purpose? :Bryan: You may guess; you evolutionists guess. . :Darrow: You are not prepared to say whether that fish was made especially to swallow a man or not? :Bryan: The Bible doesn't say, so I am not prepared to say. :Darrow: But do you believe He made them--that He made such a fish and that it was big enough to swallow Jonah? :Bryan: Yes, sir. Let me add: One miracle is just as easy to believe as another. :Darrow: Just as hard? :Bryan: It is hard to believe for you, but easy for me. A miracle is a thing performed beyond what man can perform. When you get within the realm of miracles; and it is just as easy to believe the miracle of Jonah as any other miracle in the Bible. :Darrow: Perfectly easy to believe that Jonah swallowed the whale? :Bryan: If the Bible said so; the Bible doesn't make as extreme statements as evolutionists do. :Darrow: The Bible says Joshua commanded the sun to stand still for the purpose of lengthening the day, doesn't it, and you believe it. :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Do you believe at that time the entire sun went around the earth? :Bryan: No, I believe that the earth goes around the sun. :Darrow: Do you believe that the men who wrote it thought that the day could be lengthened or that the sun could be stopped? :Bryan: I don't know what they thought. :Darrow: You don't know? :Bryan: I think they wrote the fact without expressing their own thoughts. :Darrow: Have you an opinion as to whether or not the men who wrote that thought--: Thomas Stewart: (a prosecution lawyer)--I want to object, your honor. It has gone beyond the pale of any issue that could possibly be injected into this lawsuit, except by imagination. I do not think the defendant has a right to conduct the examination any further and I ask your honor to exclude it. :Bryan: It seems to me it would be too exacting to confine the defense to the facts. If they are not allowed to get away from the facts, what have they to deal with? :Judge: Mr. Bryan is willing to be examined. Go ahead. :Darrow: Can you answer my question directly? If the day was lengthened by stopping either the earth or the sun, it must have been the earth? :Bryan: Well, I should say so. :Darrow: Now, Mr. Bryan, have you ever pondered what would have happened to the earth if it had stood still? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: You have not? :Bryan: No; the God I believe in could have taken care of that, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: I see. Have you ever pondered what would naturally happen to the earth if it stood still suddenly? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Don't you know it would have been converted into molten mass of matter? :Bryan: You testify to that when you get on the stand, I will give you a chance. :Darrow: Don't you believe it? :Bryan: I would want to hear expert testimony on that. :Darrow: You have never investigated that subject? :Bryan: I don't think I have ever had the question asked. :Darrow: Or ever thought of it? :Bryan: I have been too busy on things that I thought were of more importance. :Darrow: You believe the story of the flood to be a literal interpretation? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: When was that flood? :Bryan: I would not attempt to fix the date. The date is fixed, as suggested this morning. :Darrow: About 4004 B. C. ?: Bryan: That has been the estimate of a man that is accepted today. [A witness had testified on Bishop Ussher's theory that the Earth was formed in 4004 B. C. ] I would not say it is accurate. :Darrow: That estimate is printed in the Bible? :Bryan: Everybody knows, at least, I think most of the people know, that was the estimate given. :Darrow: But what do you think that the Bible itself says? Don't you know how it was arrived at? :Bryan: I never made a calculation. :Darrow: A calculation from what? :Bryan: I could not say. :Darrow: From the generations of man? :Bryan: I would not want to say that. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think about things I don't think about. :Darrow: Do you think about things you do think about? :Bryan: Well, sometimes. (Laughter. ): Policeman Deputy Clason: Let us have order. . .: Thomas Stewart: {prosecution attorney}--Your honor, he is perfectly able to take care of this, but we are attaining no evidence. This is not competent evidence. :Bryan: These gentlemen have not had much chance--they did not come here to try this case. They came here to try revealed religion. I am here to defend it and they can ask me any question they please. :Judge: All right. (Applause. ): Darrow: Great applause from the bleachers. :Bryan: Darrow--I have never called them yokels. :Bryan: That is the ignorance of Tennessee, the bigotry. :Darrow: You mean who are applauding you? (Applause. ): Bryan: Those are the people whom you insult. :Darrow: You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does believe in your fool religion. :Judge: I will not stand for that. :Darrow: For what he is doing? :Judge: I am talking to both of you. :Darrow: Do you know anything about how many people there were in Egypt 3, 500 years ago, or how many people there were in China 5, 000 years ago? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: Have you ever tried to find out? :Bryan: No, sir. You are the first man I ever heard of who has been interested in it. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, am I the first man you ever heard of who has been interested in the age of human societies and primitive man? :Bryan: You are the first man I ever heard speak of the number of people at those different periods. :Darrow: Where have you lived all your life? :Bryan: Not near you. (Laughter and applause. ): Darrow: Nor near anybody of learning? :Bryan: Oh, don't assume you know it all. :Darrow: Do you know there are thousands of books in our libraries on all those subjects I have been asking you about? :Bryan: I couldn't say, but I will take your word for it. . .: Darrow: Have you any idea how old the earth is? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The book you have introduced in evidence tells you, doesn't it? :Bryan: I don't think it does, Mr. Darrow. :Darrow: Let's see whether it does; is this the one? :Bryan: That is the one, I think. :Darrow: It says B. C. 4004? :Bryan: That is Bishop Ussher's calculation. :Darrow: That is printed in the Bible you introduced? :Bryan: Yes, sir. :Darrow: Would you say that the earth was only 4, 000 years old? :Bryan: Oh, no; I think it is much older than that. :Darrow: How much? :Bryan: I couldn't say. :Darrow: Do you say whether the Bible itself says it is older than that? :Bryan: I don't think it is older or not. :Darrow: Do you think the earth was made in six days? :Bryan: Not six days of 24 hours. :Darrow: Doesn't it say so? :Bryan: No, sir. :Judge: Are you about through, Mr. Darrow? :Darrow: I want to ask a few more questions about the creation. :Judge: I know. We are going to adjourn when Mr. Bryan comes off the stand for the day. Be very brief, Mr. Darrow. Of course, I believe I will make myself clearer. Of course, it is incompetent testimony before the jury. The only reason I am allowing this to go in at all is that they may have it in the appellate court as showing what the affidavit would be. :Bryan: The reason I am answering is not for the benefit of the superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him. :Darrow: I want to take an exception to this conduct of this witness. He may be very popular down here in the hills--: Bryan: Your honor, they have not asked a question legally and the only reason they have asked any question is for the purpose, as the question about Jonah was asked, for a chance to give this agnostic an opportunity to criticize a believer in the world of God; and I answered the question in order to shut his mouth so that he cannot go out and tell his atheistic friends that I would not answer his questions. That is the only reason, no more reason in the world. :Malone: (another defense counsel) Your honor on this very subject, I would like to say that I would have asked Mr. Bryan, and I consider myself as good a Christian as he is, every question that Mr. Darrow has asked him for the purpose of bringing out whether or not there is to be taken in this court a literal interpretation of the Bible, or whether, obviously, as these questions indicate, if a general and literal construction cannot be put upon the parts of the Bible which have been covered by Mr. Darrow's questions. I hope for the last time no further attempt will be made by counsel on the other side of the case, or Mr. Bryan, to say the defense is concerned at all with Mr. Darrow's particular religious views or lack of religious views. We are here as lawyers with the same right to our views. I have the same right to mine as a Christian as Mr. Bryan has to his, and we do not intend to have this case charged by Mr. Darrow's agnosticism or Mr. Bryan's brand of Christianity. (A great applause. ): Darrow: Mr. Bryan, do you believe that the first woman was Eve? :Bryan: Yes. :Darrow: Do you believe she was literally made out of Adam's rib? :Bryan: I do. :Darrow: Did you ever discover where Cain got his wife? :Bryan: No, sir. I leave the agnostics to hunt for her. :Darrow: You have never found out? :Bryan: I have never tried to find out. :Darrow: You have never tried to find out? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: The Bible says he got one, doesn't it? Were there other people on the earth at that time? :Bryan: I cannot say. :Darrow: You cannot say. Did that ever enter your consideration? :Bryan: Never bothered me. :Darrow: There were no others recorded, but Cain got a wife. :Bryan: That is what the Bible says. :Darrow: Where she came from you do not know. All right. Does the statement, \"The morning and the evening were the first day, \" and \"The morning and the evening were the second day, \" mean anything to you? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily means a 24-hour day. :Darrow: You do not? :Bryan: No. :Darrow: What do you consider it to be? :Bryan: I have not attempted to explain it. If you will take the second chapter--let me have the book. [Reaches for a Bible. ] The fourth verse of the second chapter says: \"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth, when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, \" the word day there in the very next chapter is used to describe a period. I do not see that there is any necessity for construing the words, \"the evening and the morning, \" as meaning necessarily a 24-hour day, \"in the day when the Lord made the heaven and the earth. \": Darrow: Then, when the Bible said, for instance, \"and God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day, \" that does not necessarily mean twenty-four hours? :Bryan: I do not think it necessarily does. :Darrow: Do you think it does or does not? :Bryan: I know a great many think so. :Darrow: What do you think? :Bryan: I do not think it does. :Darrow: You think those were not literal days? :Bryan: I do not think they were twenty-four-hour days. :Darrow: What do you think about it? :Bryan: That is my opinion--I do not know that my opinion is better on that subject than those who think it does. :Darrow: You do not think that? :Bryan: No. But I think it would be just as easy for the kind of God we believe in to make the earth in six days as in six years or in 6 million years or in 600 million years. I do not think it important whether we believe one or the other. :Darrow: Do you think those were literal days? :Bryan: My impression is they were periods, but I would not attempt to argue against anybody who wanted to believe in literal days. :Darrow: I will read it to you from the Bible: \"And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. \" Do you think that is why the serpent is compelled to crawl upon its belly? :Bryan: I believe that. :Darrow: Have you any idea how the snake went before that time? :Bryan: No, sir. :Darrow: Do you know whether he walked on his tail or not? :Bryan: No, sir. I have no way to know. (Laughter. ): Darrow: Now, you refer to the cloud that was put in heaven after the flood, the rainbow. Do you believe in that? :Bryan: Read it. :Darrow: All right, Mr. Bryan, I will read it for you. :Bryan: Your Honor, I think I can shorten this testimony. The only purpose Mr. Darrow has is to slur at the Bible, but I will answer his question. I will answer it all at once, and I have no objection in the world. I want the world to know that this man, who does not believe in a God, is trying to use a court in Tennessee to slur at it, and while it will require time, I am willing to take it. :Darrow: I object to your statement. I am examining you on your fool ideas that no intelligent Christian on earth believes. :Judge: Court is adjourned until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.   \n",

For instance, if there was apple tart and rice pudding, I was only allowed the rice pudding. Cold baths all the year round were insisted upon, and I had to practice the piano from seven-thirty to eight every morning although the fires were not yet lit.

The more I read, the more puzzled I was by the order of the universe and the disorder of the human mind, by the scientists who didn't agree on the how, the when, or the why of creation. Then one day this student brought me Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Reading Kant, I began to suspect everything I was taught. I no longer believed in the known God of the Bible, but rather in the mysterious God expressed in nature.   \n",

There were family prayers at eight o'clock every morning. Although there were eight servants, food was always of Spartan simplicity, and even what there was, if it was at all nice, was considered too good for children. For instance, if there was apple tart and rice pudding, I was only allowed the rice pudding. Cold baths all the year round were insisted upon, and I had to practice the piano from seven-thirty to eight every morning although the fires were not yet lit. My grandmother never allowed herself to sit in an armchair until the evening. Alcohol and tobacco were viewed with disfavor although stern convention compelled them to serve a little wine to guests. Only virtue was prized, virtue at the expense of intellect, health, happiness, and every mundane good.   \n",

I had no experience of the social pleasures of boyhood and did not miss them. But I liked mathematics, and mathematics was suspect because it has no ethical content. I came also to disagree with the theological opinions of my family, and as I grew up I became increasingly interested in philosophy, of which they profoundly disapproved. Every time the subject came up they repeated with unfailing regularity, 'What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind. ' After some fifty or sixty repetitions, this remark ceased to amuse me.   \n",

All that the Thunderer wrung from thee Was but the menace which flung back On him the torments of thy rack; The fate thou didst so well foresee, But would not to appease him tell; And in thy Silence was his Sentence, And in his Soul a vain repentance, And evil dread so ill dissembled, That in his hand the lightnings trembled.   \n",

Furthermore, the equation E = mc², in which energy is put equal to mass, multiplied by the square of the velocity of light, showed that very small amounts of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy and vice versa. The mass and energy were equivalent, according to the formula mentioned before. This was demonstrated by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932, experimentally. \" Atomic Physics (1948) by the J.

       "3  The equation originally expressed the equivalence of mass and energym = L/c², which easily translates into the far more well-known E = mc² in Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content? published in the Annalen der Physik (27 September 1905): \"If a body gives off the energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by L/c². \" In a later statement explaining the ideas expressed by this equation, Einstein summarized: \"It followed from the special theory of relativity that mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing — a somewhat unfamiliar conception for the average mind. Furthermore, the equation E = mc², in which energy is put equal to mass, multiplied by the square of the velocity of light, showed that very small amounts of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy and vice versa. The mass and energy were equivalent, according to the formula mentioned before. This was demonstrated by Cockcroft and Walton in 1932, experimentally. \" Atomic Physics (1948) by the J.

The so-called strange particles were just being discovered, and the quantum theory was proving ever more powerful. Einstein simply was not much interested. His position was that it was useless to try to understand this new physics until the electron was understood. We now believe that understanding the electron is such an intimate part of the new physics that the electron cannot be understood by itself. But Besso took all his old friend's attempts extremely seriously, and Einstein gave him detailed explanations of his various formal manipulations. It was a dialogue that somehow reminds me of the plays of Samuel Beckett.   \n",

Occasionally, gaiety would gain the upper hand and he would strike a more personal note and even disclose some detail of his day-to-day life. Then again, reverting to his characteristic mood of reflection and meditation, he would launch into a profound and original discussion of a variety of scientific and other problems. I shall always remember the enchantment of all those meetings, from which I carried away an indelible impression of Einstein's great human qualities.   \n",

Of the two, Newton is the Old Testament god; it is Einstein who is the New Testament figure. He was full of humanity, pity, a sense of enormous sympathy. His vision of nature herself was that of a human being in the presence of something god-like, and that is what he always said about nature. He was fond of talking about God: 'God does not play at dice', 'God is not malicious'. Finally Niels Bohr one day said to him, 'Stop telling God what to do'. But that is not quite fair. Einstein was a man who could ask immensely simple questions. And what his life showed, and his work, is that when the answers are simple too, then you hear God thinking.   \n",

Only at the very end of his ten-year struggle to understand gravitation did he reduce the outcome of his understanding to a finite set of field equations. But like Hilbert, as he grew older he concentrated his attention more and more on the formal properties of his equations, and he lost interest in the wider universe of ideas out of which his equations arose.

       "481  Einstein in real life was not only a great politician and a great philosopher. He was also a great observer of the human comedy, with a robust sense of humor. The third side of Einstein's personality is not emphasized by [Steven] Gimbel, but was an important cause of his immense popularity. He came as an observer to my boarding school in England in 1931, a few years before I arrived there. He was in England as the guest of Frederick Lindemann, an Oxford physicist who was also a friend and adviser to Winston Churchill. Lindemann took him to the school to meet one of the boys who was a family friend. The boy was living in Second Chamber, in an ancient building where the walls are ornamented with marble memorials to boys who occupied the rooms in past centuries. Einstein and Lindemann wandered by mistake into the adjoining First Chamber, which had been converted from a living room to a bathroom. In First Chamber, the marble memorials were preserved, but underneath them on the walls were hooks where boys had hung their smelly football clothes. Einstein surveyed the scene for a while in silence, and then said: \"Now I understand: the spirits of the departed pass over into the trousers of the living. \"   \n",

Aiming to protect the fortunes they envisaged reaping, they applied for patents in Switzerland, center of the clock-making trade. And many of their designs landed on the desk of a philosophical physicist who was originally more interested in thermodynamics than in time—Patent Officer Albert Einstein.   \n",

Balazs did not try to hide Einstein's foibles - including his impatience with pestering journalists and autograph-hunters, his selfish pursuit of what would now be called \"his own space\" - but he stressed that Einstein was a man of exceptional kindness and generosity. So was he a saint? , I asked Balazs. \"No, \" he replied firmly. \"He was better than that - he was human. \"   \n",
